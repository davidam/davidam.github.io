#+DESCRIPTION: Example of using org to create presentations using the beamer exporter
#+KEYWORDS:  beamer org orgmode
#+LANGUAGE:  en

# specifying the beamer startup gives access to a number of
# keybindings which make configuring individual slides and components
# of slides easier.  See, for instance, C-c C-b on a frame headline.
#+STARTUP: beamer

#+STARTUP: oddeven

# we tell the exporter to use a specific LaTeX document class, as
# defined in org-latex-classes.  By default, this does not include a
# beamer entry so this needs to be defined in your configuration (see
# the tutorial).
#+LaTeX_CLASS: beamer
#+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [bigger]

# Beamer supports alternate themes.  Choose your favourite here
#+BEAMER_THEME: Madrid

# the beamer exporter expects to be told which level of headlines
# defines the frames.  We use the first level headlines for sections
# and the second (hence H:2) for frames.
#+OPTIONS:   H:1 toc:t

# the following allow us to selectively choose headlines to export or not
#+SELECT_TAGS: export
#+EXCLUDE_TAGS: noexport

# for a column view of options and configurations for the individual
# frames
