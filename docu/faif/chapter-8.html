<h1><a name="CHAPTER-8">Cap&iacute;tulo 8. St. Ignucius</a></h1>
<p>The Maui High Performance Computing Center is located in a
single-story building in the dusty red hills just above the town of
Kihei. Framed by million-dollar views and the multimillion dollar
real estate of the Silversword Golf Course, the center seems like
the ultimate scientific boondoggle. Far from the boxy, sterile
confines of Tech Square or even the sprawling research metropolises
of Argonne, Illinois and Los Alamos, New Mexico, the MHPCC seems
like the kind of place where scientists spend more time on their
tans than their post-doctoral research projects.</p>
<p>The image is only half true. Although researchers at the MHPCC
do take advantage of the local recreational opportunities, they
also take their work seriously. According to Top500.org, a web site
that tracks the most powerful supercomputers in the world, the IBM
SP Power3 supercomputer housed within the MHPCC clocks in at 837
billion floating-point operations per second, making it one of 25
most powerful computers in the world. Co-owned and operated by the
University of Hawaii and the U.S. Air Force, the machine divides
its computer cycles between the number crunching tasks associated
with military logistics and high-temperature physics research.</p>
<p>Simply put, the MHPCC is a unique place, a place where the
brainy culture of science and engineering and the laid-back culture
of the Hawaiian islands coexist in peaceful equilibrium. A slogan
on the lab's 2000 web site sums it up: "Computing in paradise."</p>
<p>It's not exactly the kind of place you'd expect to find Richard
Stallman, a man who, when taking in the beautiful view of the
nearby Maui Channel through the picture windows of a staffer's
office, mutters a terse critique: "Too much sun." Still, as an
emissary from one computing paradise to another, Stallman has a
message to deliver, even if it means subjecting his pale hacker
skin to the hazards of tropical exposure.</p>
<p>The conference room is already full by the time I arrive to
catch Stallman's speech. The gender breakdown is a little better
than at the New York speech, 85% male, 15% female, but not by much.
About half of the audience members wear khaki pants and
logo-encrusted golf shirts. The other half seems to have gone
native. Dressed in the gaudy flower-print shirts so popular in this
corner of the world, their faces are a deep shade of ochre. The
only residual indication of geek status are the gadgets: Nokia cell
phones, Palm Pilots, and Sony VAIO laptops.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Stallman, who stands in front of the room
dressed in plain blue T-shirt, brown polyester slacks, and white
socks, sticks out like a sore thumb. The fluorescent lights of the
conference room help bring out the unhealthy color of his
sun-starved skin. His beard and hair are enough to trigger beads of
sweat on even the coolest Hawaiian neck. Short of having the words
"mainlander" tattooed on his forehead, Stallman couldn't look more
alien if he tried.</p>
<p>As Stallman putters around the front of the room, a few audience
members wearing T-shirts with the logo of the Maui FreeBSD Users
Group (MFUG) race to set up camera and audio equipment. FreeBSD, a
free software offshoot of the Berkeley Software Distribution, the
venerable 1970s academic version of Unix, is technically a
competitor to the GNU/Linux operating system. Still, in the hacking
world, Stallman speeches are documented with a fervor reminiscent
of the Grateful Dead and its legendary army of amateur archivists.
As the local free software heads, it's up to the MFUG members to
make sure fellow programmers in Hamburg, Mumbai, and Novosibirsk
don't miss out on the latest pearls of RMS wisdom.</p>
<p>The analogy to the Grateful Dead is apt. Often, when describing
the business opportunities inherent within the free software model,
Stallman has held up the Grateful Dead as an example. In refusing
to restrict fans' ability to record live concerts, the Grateful
Dead became more than a rock group. They became the center of a
tribal community dedicated to Grateful Dead music. Over time, that
tribal community became so large and so devoted that the band
shunned record contracts and supported itself solely through
musical tours and live appearances. In 1994, the band's last year
as a touring act, the Grateful Dead drew $52 million in gate
receipts alone. <a name="AEN1725" href="#FTN.AEN1725">[1]</a></p>
<p>While the tribal aspect of the free software community is one
reason many in the latter half of the 1990s started to accept the
notion that publishing software source code might be a good thing.
Hoping to build their own loyal followings, companies such as IBM,
Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett Packard have come to accept the
letter, if not the spirit, of the Stallman free software message.
Describing the GPL as the information-technology industry's "Magna
Carta," ZDNet software columnist Evan Leibovitch sees the growing
affection for all things GNU as more than just a trend. "This
societal shift is letting users take back control of their
futures," Leibovitch writes. "Just as the Magna Carta gave rights
to British subjects, the GPL enforces consumer rights and freedoms
on behalf of the users of computer software." <a name="AEN1734"
href="#FTN.AEN1734">[2]</a></p>
<p>The tribal aspect of the free software community also helps
explain why 40-odd programmers, who might otherwise be working on
physics projects or surfing the Web for windsurfing buoy reports,
have packed into a conference room to hear Stallman speak.</p>
<p>Unlike the New York speech, Stallman gets no introduction. He
also offers no self-introduction. When the FreeBSD people finally
get their equipment up and running, Stallman simply steps forward,
starts speaking, and steamrolls over every other voice in the
room.</p>
<p>"Most of the time when people consider the question of what
rules society should have for using software, the people
considering it are from software companies, and they consider the
question from a self-serving perspective," says Stallman, opening
his speech. "What rules can we impose on everybody else so they
have to pay us lots of money? I had the good fortune in the 1970s
to be part of a community of programmers who shared software. And
because of this I always like to look at the same issue from a
different direction to ask: what kind of rules make possible a good
society that is good for the people who are in it? And therefore I
reach completely different answers."</p>
<p>Once again, Stallman quickly segues into the parable of the
Xerox laser printer, taking a moment to deliver the same dramatic
finger-pointing gestures to the crowd. He also devotes a minute or
two to the GNU/Linux name.</p>
<p>"Some people say to me, `Why make such a fuss about getting
credit for this system? After all, the important thing is the job
is done, not whether you get recognition for it.' Well, this would
be wise advice if it were true. But the job wasn't to build an
operating system; the job is to spread freedom to the users of
computers. And to do that we have to make it possible to do
everything with computers in freedom." <a name="AEN1744" href=
"#FTN.AEN1744">[3]</a></p>
<p>Adds Stallman, "There's a lot more work to do."</p>
<p>For some in the audience, this is old material. For others, it's
a little arcane. When a member of the golf-shirt contingent starts
dozing off, Stallman stops the speech and asks somebody to wake the
person up.</p>
<p>"Somebody once said my voice was so soothing, he asked if I was
some kind of healer," says Stallman, drawing a quick laugh from the
crowd. "I guess that probably means I can help you drift gently
into a blissful, relaxing sleep. And some of you might need that. I
guess I shouldn't object if you do. If you need to sleep, by all
means do."</p>
<p>The speech ends with a brief discussion of software patents, a
growing issue of concern both within the software industry and
within the free software community. Like Napster, software patents
reflect the awkward nature of applying laws and concepts written
for the physical world to the frictionless universe of information
technology. The difference between protecting a program under
copyright and protecting a program under software patents is subtle
but significant. In the case of copyright, a software creator can
restrict duplication of the source code but not duplication of the
idea or functionality that the source code addresses. In other
words, if a developer chooses not to use a software program under
the original developer's terms, that second developer is still free
to reverse-engineer the program--i.e., duplicate the software
program's functionality by rewriting the source code from scratch.
Such duplication of ideas is common within the commercial software
industry, where companies often isolate reverse-engineering teams
to head off accusations of corporate espionage or developer
hanky-panky. In the jargon of modern software development,
companies refer to this technique as "clean room" engineering.</p>
<p>Software patents work differently. According to the U.S. Patent
Office, companies and individuals may secure patents for innovative
algorithms provided they submit their claims to a public review. In
theory, this allows the patent-holder to trade off disclosure of
their invention for a limited monopoly of a minimum of 20 years
after the patent filing. In practice, the disclosure is of limited
value, since the operation of the program is often self-evident.
Unlike copyright, a patent gives its holder the ability to head off
the independent development of software programs with the same or
similar functionality.</p>
<p>In the software industry, where 20 years can cover the entire
life cycle of a marketplace, patents take on a strategic weight.
Where companies such as Microsoft and Apple once battled over
copyright and the "look and feel" of various technologies, today's
Internet companies use patents as a way to stake out individual
applications and business models, the most notorious example being
Amazon.com's 2000 attempt to patent the company's "one-click"
online shopping process. For most companies, however, software
patents have become a defensive tool, with cross-licensing deals
balancing one set of corporate patents against another in a tense
form of corporate detente. Still, in a few notable cases of
computer encryption and graphic imaging algorithms, software
vendors have successfully stifled rival technologies.</p>
<p>For Stallman, the software-patent issue dramatizes the need for
eternal hacker vigilance. It also underlines the importance of
stressing the political benefits of free software programs over the
competitive benefits. Pointing to software patents' ability to
create sheltered regions in the marketplace, Stallman says
competitive performance and price, two areas where free software
operating systems such as GNU/Linux and FreeBSD already hold a
distinct advantage over their proprietary counterparts, are red
herrings compared to the large issues of user and developer
freedom.</p>
<p>"It's not because we don't have the talent to make better
software," says Stallman. "It's because we don't have the right.
Somebody has prohibited us from serving the public. So what's going
to happen when users encounter these gaps in free software? Well,
if they have been persuaded by the open source movement that these
freedoms are good because they lead to more-powerful reliable
software, they're likely to say, `You didn't deliver what you
promised. This software's not more powerful. It's missing this
feature. You lied to me.' But if they have come to agree with the
free software movement, that the freedom is important in itself,
then they will say, `How dare those people stop me from having this
feature and my freedom too.' And with that kind of response, we may
survive the hits that we're going to take as these patents
explode."</p>
<p>Such comments involve a hefty dose of spin, of course. Most open
source advocates are equally, if not more, vociferous as Stallman
when it comes to opposing software patents. Still, the underlying
logic of Stallman's argument--that open source advocates emphasize
the utilitarian advantages of free software over the political
advantages--remains uncontested. Rather than stress the political
significance of free software programs, open source advocates have
chosen to stress the engineering integrity of the hacker
development model. Citing the power of peer review, the open source
argument paints programs such as GNU/Linux or FreeBSD as better
built, better inspected and, by extension, more trushworthy to the
average user.</p>
<p>That's not to say the term "open source" doesn't have its
political implications. For open source advocates, the term open
source serves two purposes. First, it eliminates the confusion
associated with the word "free," a word many businesses interpret
as meaning "zero cost." Second, it allows companies to examine the
free software phenomenon on a technological, rather than ethical,
basis. Eric Raymond, cofounder of the Open Source Initiative and
one of the leading hackers to endorse the term, effectively summed
up the frustration of following Stallman down the political path in
a 1999 essay, titled "Shut Up and Show Them the Code":</p>
<a name="AEN1779"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>RMS's rhetoric is very seductive to the kind of people we are.
We hackers are thinkers and idealists who readily resonate with
appeals to "principle" and "freedom" and "rights." Even when we
disagree with bits of his program, we want RMS's rhetorical style
to work; we think it ought to work; we tend to be puzzled and
disbelieving when it fails on the 95% of people who aren't wired
like we are. <a name="AEN1781" href=
"#FTN.AEN1781">[4]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Included among that 95%, Raymond writes, are the bulk of
business managers, investors, and nonhacker computer users who,
through sheer weight of numbers, tend to decide the overall
direction of the commercial software marketplace. Without a way to
win these people over, Raymond argues, programmers are doomed to
pursue their ideology on the periphery of society:</p>
<a name="AEN1784"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>When RMS insists that we talk about "computer users' rights,"
he's issuing a dangerously attractive invitation to us to repeat
old failures. It's one we should reject--not because his principles
are wrong, but because that kind of language, applied to software,
simply does not persuade anybody but us. In fact, it confuses and
repels most people outside our culture. <a name="AEN1786" href=
"#FTN.AEN1786">[5]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Watching Stallman deliver his political message in person, it is
hard to see anything confusing or repellent. Stallman's appearance
may seem off-putting, but his message is logical. When an audience
member asks if, in shunning proprietary software, free software
proponents lose the ability to keep up with the latest
technological advancements, Stallman answers the question in terms
of his own personal beliefs. "I think that freedom is more
important than mere technical advance," he says. "I would always
choose a less advanced free program rather than a more advanced
nonfree program, because I won't give up my freedom for something
like that. My rule is, if I can't share it with you, I won't take
it."</p>
<p>Such answers, however, reinforce the quasi-religious nature of
the Stallman message. Like a Jew keeping kosher or a Mormon
refusing to drink alcohol, Stallman paints his decision to use free
software in the place of proprietary in the color of tradition and
personal belief. As software evangelists go, Stallman avoids
forcing those beliefs down listeners' throats. Then again, a
listener rarely leaves a Stallman speech not knowing where the true
path to software righteousness lies.</p>
<p>As if to drive home this message, Stallman punctuates his speech
with an unusual ritual. Pulling a black robe out of a plastic
grocery bag, Stallman puts it on. Out of a second bag, he pulls a
reflective yellow computer disk and places it on his head. The
crowd lets out a startled laugh.</p>
<p>"I am St. Ignucius of the Church of Emacs," says Stallman,
raising his right hand in mock-blessing. "I bless your computer, my
child."</p>
<p>The laughter turns into full-blown applause after a few seconds.
As audience members clap, the computer disk on Stallman's head
catches the glare of an overhead light, eliciting a perfect halo
effect. In the blink of an eye, Stallman goes from awkward
<em>haole</em> to Russian religious icon.</p>
<p>"Emacs was initially a text editor," says Stallman, explaining
the getup. "Eventually it became a way of life for many and a
religion for some. We call this religion the Church of Emacs."</p>
<p>The skit is a lighthearted moment of self-pardoy, a humorous
return-jab at the many people who might see Stallman's form of
software asceticism as religious fanaticism in disguise. It is also
the sound of the other shoe dropping-loudly. It's as if, in donning
his robe and halo, Stallman is finally letting listeners of the
hook, saying, "It's OK to laugh. I know I'm weird."</p>
<p>Discussing the St. Ignucius persona afterward, Stallman says he
first came up with it in 1996, long after the creation of Emacs but
well before the emergence of the "open source" term and the
struggle for hacker-community leadership that precipitated it. At
the time, Stallman says, he wanted a way to "poke fun at himself,"
to remind listeners that, though stubborn, Stallman was not the
fanatic some made him out to be. It was only later, Stallman adds,
that others seized the persona as a convenient way to play up his
reputation as software ideologue, as Eric Raymond did in an 1999
interview with the linux.com web site:</p>
<a name="AEN1810"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>When I say RMS calibrates what he does, I'm not belittling or
accusing him of insincerity. I'm saying that like all good
communicators he's got a theatrical streak. Sometimes it's
conscious-have you ever seen him in his St. Ignucius drag, blessing
software with a disk platter on his head? Mostly it's unconscious;
he's just learned the degree of irritating stimulus that works,
that holds attention without (usually) freaking people out.
   <a name="AEN1812" href="#FTN.AEN1812">[6]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Stallman takes issue with the Raymond analysis. "It's simply my
way of making fun of myself," he says. "The fact that others see it
as anything more than that is a reflection of their agenda, not
mine."</p>
<p>That said, Stallman does admit to being a ham. "Are you
kidding?" he says at one point. "I love being the center of
attention." To facilitate that process, Stallman says he once
enrolled in Toastmasters, an organization that helps members
bolster their public-speaking skills and one Stallman recommends
highly to others. He possesses a stage presence that would be the
envy of most theatrical performers and feels a link to
vaudevillians of years past. A few days after the Maui High
Performance Computing Center speech, I allude to the 1999
LinuxWorld performace and ask Stallman if he has a Groucho Marx
complex--i.e., the unwillingness to belong to any club that would
have him as a member. Stallman's response is immediate: "No, but I
admire Groucho Marx in a lot of ways and certainly have been in
some things I say inspired by him. But then I've also been inspired
in some ways by Harpo."</p>
<p>The Groucho Marx influence is certainly evident in Stallman's
lifelong fondness for punning. Then again, punning and wordplay are
common hacker traits. Perhaps the most Groucho-like aspect of
Stallman's personality, however, is the deadpan manner in which the
puns are delivered. Most come so stealthily--without even the hint
of a raised eyebrow or upturned smile--you almost have to wonder if
Stallman's laughing at his audience more than the audience is
laughing at him.</p>
<p>Watching members of the Maui High Performance Computer Center
laugh at the St. Ignucius parody, such concerns evaporate. While
not exactly a standup act, Stallman certainly possesses the chops
to keep a roomful of engineers in stitches. "To be a saint in the
Church of Emacs does not require celibacy, but it does require
making a commitment to living a life of moral purity," he tells the
Maui audience. "You must exorcise the evil proprietary operating
system from all your computer and then install a wholly [holy] free
operating system. And then you must install only free software on
top of that. If you make this commitment and live by it, then you
too will be a saint in the Church of Emacs, and you too may have a
halo."</p>
<p>The St. Ignucius skit ends with a brief inside joke. On most
Unix systems and Unix-related offshoots, the primary competitor
program to Emacs is vi, a text-editing program developed by former
UC Berkeley student and current Sun Microsystems chief scientist,
Bill Joy. Before doffing his "halo," Stallman pokes fun at the
rival program. "People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the
Church of Emacs to use vi," he says. "Using a free version of vi is
not a sin; it is a penance. So happy hacking."</p>
<p>After a brief question-and-answer session, audience members
gather around Stallman. A few ask for autographs. "I'll sign this,"
says Stallman, holding up one woman's print out of the GNU General
Public License, "but only if you promise me to use the term
GNU/Linux instead of Linux and tell all your friends to do
likewise."</p>
<p>The comment merely confirms a private observation. Unlike other
stage performers and political figures, Stallman has no "off" mode.
Aside from the St. Ignucius character, the ideologue you see
onstage is the ideologue you meet backstage. Later that evening,
during a dinner conversation in which a programmer mentions his
affinity for "open source" programs, Stallman, between bites,
upbraids his tablemate: "You mean free software. That's the proper
way to refer to it."</p>
<p>During the question-and-answer session, Stallman admits to
playing the pedagogue at times. "There are many people who say,
`Well, first let's invite people to join the community, and then
let's teach them about freedom.' And that could be a reasonable
strategy, but what we have is almost everybody's inviting people to
join the community, and hardly anybody's teaching them about
freedom once they come in."</p>
<p>The result, Stallman says, is something akin to a third-world
city. People move in, hoping to strike it rich or at the very least
to take part in a vibrant, open culture, and yet those who hold the
true power keep evolving new tricks and strategies--i.e., software
patents--to keep the masses out. "You have millions of people
moving in and building shantytowns, but nobody's working on step
two: getting them out of those shantytowns. If you think talking
about software freedom is a good strategy, please join in doing
step two. There are plenty working on step one. We need more people
working on step two."</p>
<p>Working on "step two" means driving home the issue that freedom,
not acceptance, is the root issue of the free software movement.
Those who hope to reform the proprietary software industry from the
inside are on a fool's errand. "Change from the inside is risky,"
Stallman stays. "Unless you're working at the level of a Gorbachev,
you're going to be neutralized."</p>
<p>Hands pop up. Stallman points to a member of the golf
shirt-wearing contingent. "Without patents, how would you suggest
dealing with commercial espionage?"</p>
<p>"Well, those two questions have nothing to do with each other,
really," says Stallman.</p>
<p>"But I mean if someone wants to steal another company's piece of
software."</p>
<p>Stallman's recoils as if hit by a poisonous spray. "Wait a
second," Stallman says. "Steal? I'm sorry, there's so much
prejudice in that statement that the only thing I can say is that I
reject that prejudice. Companies that develop nonfree software and
other things keep lots and lots of trade secrets, and so that's not
really likely to change. In the old days--even in the 1980s--for
the most part programmers were not aware that there were even
software patents and were paying no attention to them. What
happened was that people published the interesting ideas, and if
they were not in the free software movement, they kept secret the
little details. And now they patent those broad ideas and keep
secret the little details. So as far as what you're describing,
patents really make no difference to it one way or another."</p>
<p>"But if it doesn't affect their publication," a new audience
member jumps in, his voice trailing off almost as soon as he starts
speaking.</p>
<p>"But it does," Stallman says. "Their publication is telling you
that this is an idea that's off limits to the rest of the community
for 20 years. And what the hell good is that? Besides, they've
written it in such a hard way to read, both to obfuscate the idea
and to make the patent as broad as possible, that it's basically
useless looking at the published information to learn anything
anyway. The only reason to look at patents is to see the bad news
of what you can't do."</p>
<p>The audience falls silent. The speech, which began at 3:15, is
now nearing the 5:00 whistle, and most listeners are already
squirming in their seats, antsy to get a jump start on the weekend.
Sensing the fatigue, Stallman glances around the room and hastily
shuts things down. "So it looks like we're done," he says,
following the observation with an auctioneer's "going, going, gone"
to flush out any last-minute questioners. When nobody throws their
hand up, Stallman signs off with a traditional exit line.</p>
<p>"Happy hacking," he says.</p></div>

<p>For narrative purposes, I have hesitated to go in-depth when
describing Stallman's full definition of software "freedom." The
GNU Project web site lists four fundamental components:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: disc">
<p>The freedom to run a program, for any purpose (freedom
0).</p></li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc">
<p>The freedom to study how a program works, and adapt it to your
needs (freedom 1).</p></li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc">
<p>The freedom to redistribute copies of a program so you can help
your neighbor (freedom 2).</p></li>
<li style="list-style-type: disc">
<p>The freedom to improve the program, and release your
improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits
(freedom 3).</p></li></ul>
