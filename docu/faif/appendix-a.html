<h1><a name="APPENDIX-A">Ap&eacute;ndice A. Terminology</a></h1>
<p>For the most part, I have chosen to use the term GNU/Linux in
reference to the free software operating system and Linux when
referring specifically to the kernel that drives the operating
system. The most notable exception to this rule comes in
   <a href="chapter-9.html">Cap&iacute;tulo 9</a>. In the final
   part of that chapter, I describe the early evolution of Linux as
   an offshoot of Minix. It is safe to say that during the first
   two years of the project's development, the operating system
   Torvalds and his colleagues were working on bore little
   similarity to the GNU system envisioned by Stallman, even though
   it gradually began to share key components, such as the GNU C
   Compiler and the GNU Debugger.</p>
<p>This decision further benefits from the fact that, prior to
1993, Stallman saw little need to insist on credit.</p>
<p>Some might view the decision to use GNU/Linux for later versions
of the same operating system as arbitrary. I would like to point
out that it was in no way a prerequisite for gaining Stallman's
cooperation in the making of this book. I came to it of my own
accord, partly because of the operating system's modular nature and
the community surrounding it, and partly because of the apolitical
nature of the Linux name. Given that this is a biography of Richard
Stallman, it seemed inappropriate to define the operating system in
apolitical terms.</p>
<p>In the final phases of the book, when it became clear that
O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates would be the book's publisher,
Stallman did make it a condition that I use "GNU/Linux" instead of
Linux if O'Reilly expected him to provide promotional support for
the book after publication. When informed of this, I relayed my
earlier decision and left it up to Stallman to judge whether the
resulting book met this condition or not. At the time of this
writing, I have no idea what Stallman's judgment will be.</p>
<p>A similar situation surrounds the terms "free software" and
"open source." Again, I have opted for the more politically laden
"free software" term when describing software programs that come
with freely copyable and freely modifiable source code. Although
more popular, I have chosen to use the term "open source" only when
referring to groups and businesses that have championed its usage.
But for a few instances, the terms are completely interchangeable,
and in making this decision I have followed the advice of Christine
Peterson, the person generally credited with coining the term. "The
`free software' term should still be used in circumstances where it
works better," Peterson writes. "[`Open source'] caught on mainly
because a new term was greatly needed, not because it's
ideal."</p></div>
