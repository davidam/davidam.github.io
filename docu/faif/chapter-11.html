<h1><a name="CHAPTER-11">Cap&iacute;tulo 11. Open Source</a></h1>
<p>In November, 1995, Peter Salus, a member of the Free Software
Foundation and author of the 1994 book, [<span class="CITATION">A
Quarter Century of Unix</span>], issued a call for papers to
members of the GNU Project's "system-discuss" mailing list. Salus,
the conference's scheduled chairman, wanted to tip off fellow
hackers about the upcoming Conference on Freely Redistributable
Software in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Slated for February, 1996 and
sponsored by the Free Software Foundation, the event promised to be
the first engineering conference solely dedicated to free software
and, in a show of unity with other free software programmers,
welcomed papers on "any aspect of GNU, Linux, NetBSD, 386BSD,
FreeBSD, Perl, Tcl/tk, and other tools for which the code is
accessible and redistributable." Salus wrote:</p>
<a name="AEN2374"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>Over the past 15 years, free and low-cost software has become
ubiquitous. This conference will bring together implementers of
several different types of freely redistributable software and
publishers of such software (on various media). There will be
tutorials and refereed papers, as well as keynotes by Linus
Torvalds and Richard Stallman. <a name="AEN2376" href=
"#FTN.AEN2376">[1]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>One of the first people to receive Salus' email was conference
committee member Eric S. Raymond. Although not the leader of a
project or company like the various other members of the list,
Raymond had built a tidy reputation within the hacker community as
a major contributor to GNU Emacs and as editor of
      [<span class="CITATION">The New Hacker Dictionary</span>], a
      book version of the hacking community's decade-old Jargon
      File.</p>
<p>For Raymond, the 1996 conference was a welcome event. Active in
the GNU Project during the 1980s, Raymond had distanced himself
from the project in 1992, citing, like many others before him,
Stallman's "micro-management" style. "Richard kicked up a fuss
about my making unauthorized modifications when I was cleaning up
the Emacs LISP libraries," Raymond recalls. "It frustrated me so
much that I decided I didn't want to work with him anymore."</p>
<p>Despite the falling out, Raymond remained active in the free
software community. So much so that when Salus suggested a
conference pairing Stallman and Torvalds as keynote speakers,
Raymond eagerly seconded the idea. With Stallman representing the
older, wiser contingent of ITS/Unix hackers and Torvalds
representing the younger, more energetic crop of Linux hackers, the
pairing indicated a symbolic show of unity that could only be
beneficial, especially to ambitious younger (i.e., below 40)
hackers such as Raymond. "I sort of had a foot in both camps,"
Raymond says.</p>
<p>By the time of the conference, the tension between those two
camps had become palpable. Both groups had one thing in common,
though: the conference was their first chance to meet the Finnish
<em>wunderkind</em> in the flesh. Surprisingly, Torvalds proved
himself to be a charming, affable speaker. Possessing only a slight
Swedish accent, Torvalds surprised audience members with his quick,
self-effacing wit. <a name="AEN2393" href=
"#FTN.AEN2393">[2]</a></p>
<p>Even more surprising, says Raymond, was Torvalds' equal
willingness to take potshots at other prominent hackers, including
the most prominent hacker of all, Richard Stallman. By the end of
the conference, Torvalds' half-hacker, half-slacker manner was
winning over older and younger conference-goers alike.</p>
<p>"It was a pivotal moment," recalls Raymond. "Before 1996,
Richard was the only credible claimant to being the ideological
leader of the entire culture. People who dissented didn't do so in
public. The person who broke that taboo was Torvalds."</p>
<p>The ultimate breach of taboo would come near the end of the
show. During a discussion on the growing market dominance of
Microsoft Windows or some similar topic, Torvalds admitted to being
a fan of Microsoft's PowerPoint slideshow software program. From
the perspective of old-line software purists, it was like a Mormon
bragging in church about his fondness of whiskey. From the
perspective of Torvalds and his growing band of followers, it was
simply common sense. Why shun worthy proprietary software programs
just to make a point? Being a hacker wasn't about suffering, it was
about getting the job done.</p>
<p>"That was a pretty shocking thing to say," Raymond remembers.
"Then again, he was able to do that, because by 1995 and 1996, he
was rapidly acquiring clout."</p>
<p>Stallman, for his part, doesn't remember any tension at the 1996
conference, but he does remember later feeling the sting of
Torvalds' celebrated cheekiness. "There was a thing in the Linux
documentation which says print out the GNU coding standards and
then tear them up," says Stallman, recalling one example. "OK, so
he disagrees with some of our conventions. That's fine, but he
picked a singularly nasty way of saying so. He could have just said
`Here's the way I think you should indent your code.' Fine. There
should be no hostility there."</p>
<p>For Raymond, the warm reception other hackers gave to Torvalds'
comments merely confirmed his suspicions. The dividing line
separating Linux developers from GNU/Linux developers was largely
generational. Many Linux hackers, like Torvalds, had grown up in a
world of proprietary software. Unless a program was clearly
inferior, most saw little reason to rail against a program on
licensing issues alone. Somewhere in the universe of free software
systems lurked a program that hackers might someday turn into a
free software alternative to PowerPoint. Until then, why begrudge
Microsoft the initiative of developing the program and reserving
the rights to it?</p>
<p>As a former GNU Project member, Raymond sensed an added dynamic
to the tension between Stallman and Torvalds. In the decade since
launching the GNU Project, Stallman had built up a fearsome
reputation as a programmer. He had also built up a reputation for
intransigence both in terms of software design and people
management. Shortly before the 1996 conference, the Free Software
Foundation would experience a full-scale staff defection, blamed in
large part on Stallman. Brian Youmans, a current FSF staffer hired
by Salus in the wake of the resignations, recalls the scene: "At
one point, Peter [Salus] was the only staff member working in the
office."</p>
<p>For Raymond, the defection merely confirmed a growing suspicion:
recent delays such as the HURD and recent troubles such as the
Lucid-Emacs schism reflected problems normally associated with
software project management, not software code development. Shortly
after the Freely Redistributable Software Conference, Raymond began
working on his own pet software project, a popmail utility called
"fetchmail." Taking a cue from Torvalds, Raymond issued his program
with a tacked-on promise to update the source code as early and as
often as possible. When users began sending in bug reports and
feature suggestions, Raymond, at first anticipating a tangled mess,
found the resulting software surprisingly sturdy. Analyzing the
success of the Torvalds approach, Raymond issued a quick analysis:
using the Internet as his "petri dish" and the harsh scrutiny of
the hacker community as a form of natural selection, Torvalds had
created an evolutionary model free of central planning.</p>
<p>What's more, Raymond decided, Torvalds had found a way around
Brooks' Law. First articulated by Fred P. Brooks, manager of IBM's
OS/360 project and author of the 1975 book, [<span class=
"CITATION">The Mythical Man-Month</span>], Brooks' Law held that
adding developers to a project only resulted in further project
delays. Believing as most hackers that software, like soup,
benefits from a limited number of cooks, Raymond sensed something
revolutionary at work. In inviting more and more cooks into the
kitchen, Torvalds had actually found away to make the resulting
software <em>better</em>. <a name="AEN2430" href=
"#FTN.AEN2430">[3]</a></p>
<p>Raymond put his observations on paper. He crafted them into a
speech, which he promptly delivered before a group of friends and
neighbors in Chester County, Pennsylvania. Dubbed "The Cathedral
and the Bazaar," the speech contrasted the management styles of the
GNU Project with the management style of Torvalds and the kernel
hackers. Raymond says the response was enthusiastic, but not nearly
as enthusiastic as the one he received during the 1997 Linux
Kongress, a gathering of Linux users in Germany the next
spring.</p>
<p>"At the Kongress, they gave me a standing ovation at the end of
the speech," Raymond recalls. "I took that as significant for two
reasons. For one thing, it meant they were excited by what they
were hearing. For another thing, it meant they were excited even
after hearing the speech delivered through a language barrier."</p>
<p>Eventually, Raymond would convert the speech into a paper, also
titled "The Cathedral and the Bazaar." The paper drew its name from
Raymond's central analogy. GNU programs were "cathedrals,"
impressive, centrally planned monuments to the hacker ethic, built
to stand the test of time. Linux, on the other hand, was more like
"a great babbling bazaar," a software program developed through the
loose decentralizing dynamics of the Internet.</p>
<p>Implicit within each analogy was a comparison of Stallman and
Torvalds. Where Stallman served as the classic model of the
cathedral architect--i.e., a programming "wizard" who could
disappear for 18 months and return with something like the GNU C
Compiler--Torvalds was more like a genial dinner-party host. In
letting others lead the Linux design discussion and stepping in
only when the entire table needed a referee, Torvalds had created a
development model very much reflective of his own laid-back
personality. From the Torvalds' perspective, the most important
managerial task was not imposing control but keeping the ideas
flowing.</p>
<p>Summarized Raymond, "I think Linus's cleverest and most
consequential hack was not the construction of the Linux kernel
itself, but rather his invention of the Linux development model."
<a name="AEN2446" href="#FTN.AEN2446">[4]</a></p>
<p>In summarizing the secrets of Torvalds' managerial success,
Raymond himself had pulled off a coup. One of the audience members
at the Linux Kongress was Tim O'Reilly, publisher of O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, a company specializing in software manuals and
software-related books (and the publisher of this book). After
hearing Raymond's Kongress speech, O'Reilly promptly invited
Raymond to deliver it again at the company's inaugural Perl
Conference later that year in Monterey, California.</p>
<p>Although the conference was supposed to focus on Perl, a
scripting language created by Unix hacker Larry Wall, O'Reilly
assured Raymond that the conference would address other free
software technologies. Given the growing commercial interest in
Linux and Apache, a popular free software web server, O'Reilly
hoped to use the event to publicize the role of free software in
creating the entire infrastructure of the Internet. From
web-friendly languages such as Perl and Python to back-room
programs such as BIND (the Berkeley Internet Naming Daemon), a
software tool that lets users replace arcane IP numbers with the
easy-to-remember domain-name addresses (e.g., amazon.com), and
sendmail, the most popular mail program on the Internet, free
software had become an emergent phenomenon. Like a colony of ants
creating a beautiful nest one grain of sand at a time, the only
thing missing was the communal self-awareness. O'Reilly saw
Raymond's speech as a good way to inspire that self-awareness, to
drive home the point that free software development didn't start
and end with the GNU Project. Programming languages, such as Perl
and Python, and Internet software, such as BIND, sendmail, and
Apache, demonstrated that free software was already ubiquitous and
influential. He also assured Raymond an even warmer reception than
the one at Linux Kongress.</p>
<p>O'Reilly was right. "This time, I got the standing ovation
before the speech," says Raymond, laughing.</p>
<p>As predicted, the audience was stocked not only with hackers,
but with other people interested in the growing power of the free
software movement. One contingent included a group from Netscape,
the Mountain View, California startup then nearing the end game of
its three-year battle with Microsoft for control of the web-browser
market.</p>
<p>Intrigued by Raymond's speech and anxious to win back lost
market share, Netscape executives took the message back to
corporate headquarters. A few months later, in January, 1998, the
company announced its plan to publish the source code of its
flagship Navigator web browser in the hopes of enlisting hacker
support in future development.</p>
<p>When Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale cited Raymond's "Cathedral and
the Bazaar" essay as a major influence upon the company's decision,
the company instantly elevated Raymond to the level of hacker
celebrity. Determined not to squander the opportunity, Raymond
traveled west to deliver interviews, advise Netscape executives,
and take part in the eventual party celebrating the publication of
Netscape Navigator's source code. The code name for Navigator's
source code was "Mozilla": a reference both to the program's
gargantuan size--30 million lines of code--and to its heritage.
Developed as a proprietary offshoot of Mosaic, the web browser
created by Marc Andreessen at the University of Illinois, Mozilla
was proof, yet again, that when it came to building new programs,
most programmers preferred to borrow on older, modifiable
programs.</p>
<p>While in California, Raymond also managed to squeeze in a visit
to VA Research, a Santa Clara-based company selling workstations
with the GNU/Linux operating system preinstalled. Convened by
Raymond, the meeting was small. The invite list included VA founder
Larry Augustin, a few VA employees, and Christine Peterson,
president of the Foresight Institute, a Silicon Valley think tank
specializing in nanotechnology.</p>
<p>"The meeting's agenda boiled down to one item: how to take
advantage of Netscape's decision so that other companies might
follow suit?" Raymond doesn't recall the conversation that took
place, but he does remember the first complaint addressed. Despite
the best efforts of Stallman and other hackers to remind people
that the word "free" in free software stood for freedom and not
price, the message still wasn't getting through. Most business
executives, upon hearing the term for the first time, interpreted
the word as synonymous with "zero cost," tuning out any follow up
messages in short order. Until hackers found a way to get past this
cognitive dissonance, the free software movement faced an uphill
climb, even after Netscape.</p>
<p>Peterson, whose organization had taken an active interest in
advancing the free software cause, offered an alternative: open
source.</p>
<p>Looking back, Peterson says she came up with the open source
term while discussing Netscape's decision with a friend in the
public relations industry. She doesn't remember where she came upon
the term or if she borrowed it from another field, but she does
remember her friend disliking the term. <a name="AEN2496" href=
"#FTN.AEN2496">[5]</a></p>
<p>At the meeting, Peterson says, the response was dramatically
different. "I was hesitant about suggesting it," Peterson recalls.
"I had no standing with the group, so started using it casually,
not highlighting it as a new term." To Peterson's surprise, the
term caught on. By the end of the meeting, most of the attendees,
including Raymond, seemed pleased by it.</p>
<p>Raymond says he didn't publicly use the term "open source" as a
substitute for free software until a day or two after the Mozilla
launch party, when O'Reilly had scheduled a meeting to talk about
free software. Calling his meeting "the Freeware Summit," O'Reilly
says he wanted to direct media and community attention to the other
deserving projects that had also encouraged Netscape to release
Mozilla. "All these guys had so much in common, and I was surprised
they didn't all know each other," says O'Reilly. "I also wanted to
let the world know just how great an impact the free software
culture had already made. People were missing out on a large part
of the free software tradition."</p>
<p>In putting together the invite list, however, O'Reilly made a
decision that would have long-term political consequences. He
decided to limit the list to west-coast developers such as Wall,
Eric Allman, creator of sendmail, and Paul Vixie, creator of BIND.
There were exceptions, of course: Pennsylvania-resident Raymond,
who was already in town thanks to the Mozilla launch, earned an
quick invite. So did Virginia-resident Guido van Rossum, creator of
Python. "Frank Willison, my editor in chief and champion of Python
within the company, invited him without first checking in with me,"
O'Reilly recalls. "I was happy to have him there, but when I
started, it really was just a local gathering."</p>
<p>For some observers, the unwillingness to include Stallman's name
on the list qualified as a snub. "I decided not to go to the event
because of it," says Perens, remembering the summit. Raymond, who
did go, says he argued for Stallman's inclusion to no avail. The
snub rumor gained additional strength from the fact that O'Reilly,
the event's host, had feuded publicly with Stallman over the issue
of software-manual copyrights. Prior to the meeting, Stallman had
argued that free software manuals should be as freely copyable and
modifiable as free software programs. O'Reilly, meanwhile, argued
that a value-added market for nonfree books increased the utility
of free software by making it more accessible to a wider community.
The two had also disputed the title of the event, with Stallman
insisting on "Free Software" over the less politically laden
"Freeware."</p>
<p>Looking back, O'Reilly doesn't see the decision to leave
Stallman's name off the invite list as a snub. "At that time, I had
never met Richard in person, but in our email interactions, he'd
been inflexible and unwilling to engage in dialogue. I wanted to
make sure the GNU tradition was represented at the meeting, so I
invited John Gilmore and Michael Tiemann, whom I knew personally,
and whom I knew were passionate about the value of the GPL but
seemed more willing to engage in a frank back-and-forth about the
strengths and weaknesses of the various free software projects and
traditions. Given all the later brouhaha, I do wish I'd invited
Richard as well, but I certainly don't think that my failure to do
so should be interpreted as a lack of respect for the GNU Project
or for Richard personally."</p>
<p>Snub or no snub, both O'Reilly and Raymond say the term "open
source" won over just enough summit-goers to qualify as a success.
The attendees shared ideas and experiences and brainstormed on how
to improve free software's image. Of key concern was how to point
out the successes of free software, particularly in the realm of
Internet infrastructure, as opposed to playing up the GNU/Linux
challenge to Microsoft Windows. But like the earlier meeting at VA,
the discussion soon turned to the problems associated with the term
"free software." O'Reilly, the summit host, remembers a
particularly insightful comment from Torvalds, a summit
attendee.</p>
<p>"Linus had just moved to Silicon Valley at that point, and he
explained how only recently that he had learned that the word
`free' had two meanings-free as in `libre' and free as in
`gratis'-in English."</p>
<p>Michael Tiemann, founder of Cygnus, proposed an alternative to
the troublesome "free software" term: sourceware. "Nobody got too
excited about it," O'Reilly recalls. "That's when Eric threw out
the term `open source.'"</p>
<p>Although the term appealed to some, support for a change in
official terminology was far from unanimous. At the end of the
one-day conference, attendees put the three terms--free software,
open source, or sourceware--to a vote. According to O'Reilly, 9 out
of the 15 attendees voted for "open source." Although some still
quibbled with the term, all attendees agreed to use it in future
discussions with the press. "We wanted to go out with a solidarity
message," O'Reilly says.</p>
<p>The term didn't take long to enter the national lexicon. Shortly
after the summit, O'Reilly shepherded summit attendees to a press
conference attended by reporters from the [<span class=
"CITATION">New York Times</span>], the [<span class="CITATION">Wall
Street Journal</span>], and other prominent publications. Within a
few months, Torvalds' face was appearing on the cover of
[<span class="CITATION">Forbes</span>] magazine, with the faces of
Stallman, Perl creator Larry Wall, and Apache team leader Brian
Behlendorf featured in the interior spread. Open source was open
for business.</p>
<p>For summit attendees such as Tiemann, the solidarity message was
the most important thing. Although his company had achieved a fair
amount of success selling free software tools and services, he
sensed the difficulty other programmers and entrepreneurs
faced.</p>
<p>"There's no question that the use of the word free was confusing
in a lot of situations," Tiemann says. "Open source positioned
itself as being business friendly and business sensible. Free
software positioned itself as morally righteous. For better or
worse we figured it was more advantageous to align with the open
source crowd."</p>
<p>For Stallman, the response to the new "open source" term was
slow in coming. Raymond says Stallman briefly considered adopting
the term, only to discard it. "I know because I had direct personal
conversations about it," Raymond says.</p>
<p>By the end of 1998, Stallman had formulated a position: open
source, while helpful in communicating the technical advantages of
free software, also encouraged speakers to soft-pedal the issue of
software freedom. Given this drawback, Stallman would stick with
the term free software.</p>
<p>Summing up his position at the 1999 LinuxWorld Convention and
Expo, an event billed by Torvalds himself as a "coming out party"
for the Linux community, Stallman implored his fellow hackers to
resist the lure of easy compromise.</p>
<p>"Because we've shown how much we can do, we don't have to be
desperate to work with companies or compromise our goals," Stallman
said during a panel discussion. "Let them offer and we'll accept.
We don't have to change what we're doing to get them to help us.
You can take a single step towards a goal, then another and then
more and more and you'll actually reach your goal. Or, you can take
a half measure that means you don't ever take another step and
you'll never get there."</p>
<p>Even before the LinuxWorld show, however, Stallman was showing
an increased willingness to alienate his more conciliatory peers. A
few months after the Freeware Summit, O'Reilly hosted its second
annual Perl Conference. This time around, Stallman was in
attendance. During a panel discussion lauding IBM's decision to
employ the free software Apache web server in its commercial
offerings, Stallman, taking advantage of an audience microphone,
disrupted the proceedings with a tirade against panelist John
Ousterhout, creator of the Tcl scripting language. Stallman branded
Ousterhout a "parasite" on the free software community for
marketing a proprietary version of Tcl via Ousterhout's startup
company, Scriptics. "I don't think Scriptics is necessary for the
continued existence of Tcl," Stallman said to hisses from the
fellow audience members. <a name="AEN2548" href=
"#FTN.AEN2548">[6]</a></p>
<p>"It was a pretty ugly scene," recalls Prime Time Freeware's Rich
Morin. "John's done some pretty respectable things: Tcl, Tk,
Sprite. He's a real contributor."</p>
<p>Despite his sympathies for Stallman and Stallman's position,
Morin felt empathy for those troubled by Stallman's discordant
behavior.</p>
<p>Stallman's Perl Conference outburst would momentarily chase off
another potential sympathizer, Bruce Perens. In 1998, Eric Raymond
proposed launching the Open Source Initiative, or OSI, an
organization that would police the use of the term "open source"
and provide a definition for companies interested in making their
own programs. Raymond recruited Perens to draft the definition.
<a name="AEN2566" href="#FTN.AEN2566">[7]</a></p>
<p>Perens would later resign from the OSI, expressing regret that
the organization had set itself up in opposition to Stallman and
the FSF. Still, looking back on the need for a free software
definition outside the Free Software Foundation's auspices, Perens
understands why other hackers might still feel the need for
distance. "I really like and admire Richard," says Perens. "I do
think Richard would do his job better if Richard had more balance.
That includes going away from free software for a couple of
months."</p>
<p>Stallman's monomaniacal energies would do little to counteract
the public-relations momentum of open source proponents. In August
of 1998, when chip-maker Intel purchased a stake in GNU/Linux
vendor Red Hat, an accompanying [<span class="CITATION">New York
Times</span>] article described the company as the product of a
movement "known alternatively as free software and open source."
<a name="AEN2581" href="#FTN.AEN2581">[8]</a> Six months later, a
John Markoff article on Apple Computer was proclaiming the
company's adoption of the "open source" Apache server in the
article headline. <a name="AEN2584" href="#FTN.AEN2584">[9]</a></p>
<p>Such momentum would coincide with the growing momentum of
companies that actively embraced the "open source" term. By August
of 1999, Red Hat, a company that now eagerly billed itself as "open
source," was selling shares on Nasdaq. In December, VA
Linux--formerly VA Research--was floating its own IPO to historical
effect. Opening at $30 per share, the company's stock price
exploded past the $300 mark in initial trading only to settle back
down to the $239 level. Shareholders lucky enough to get in at the
bottom and stay until the end experienced a 698% increase in paper
wealth, a Nasdaq record.</p>
<p>Among those lucky shareholders was Eric Raymond, who, as a
company board member since the Mozilla launch, had received 150,000
shares of VA Linux stock. Stunned by the realization that his essay
contrasting the Stallman-Torvalds managerial styles had netted him
$36 million in potential wealth, Raymond penned a follow-up essay.
In it, Raymond mused on the relationship between the hacker ethic
and monetary wealth:</p>
<a name="AEN2591"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>Reporters often ask me these days if I think the open-source
community will be corrupted by the influx of big money. I tell them
what I believe, which is this: commercial demand for programmers
has been so intense for so long that anyone who can be seriously
distracted by money is already gone. Our community has been
self-selected for caring about other things-accomplishment, pride,
artistic passion, and each other. <a name="AEN2593" href=
"#FTN.AEN2593">[10]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Whether or not such comments allayed suspicions that Raymond and
other open source proponents had simply been in it for the money,
they drove home the open source community's ultimate message: all
you needed to sell the free software concept is a friendly face and
a sensible message. Instead of fighting the marketplace head-on as
Stallman had done, Raymond, Torvalds, and other new leaders of the
hacker community had adopted a more relaxed approach-ignoring the
marketplace in some areas, leveraging it in others. Instead of
playing the role of high-school outcasts, they had played the game
of celebrity, magnifying their power in the process.</p>
<p>"On his worst days Richard believes that Linus Torvalds and I
conspired to hijack his revolution," Raymond says. "Richard's
rejection of the term open source and his deliberate creation of an
ideological fissure in my view comes from an odd mix of idealism
and territoriality. There are people out there who think it's all
Richard's personal ego. I don't believe that. It's more that he so
personally associates himself with the free software idea that he
sees any threat to that as a threat to himself."</p>
<p>Ironically, the success of open source and open source advocates
such as Raymond would not diminish Stallman's role as a leader. If
anything, it gave Stallman new followers to convert. Still, the
Raymond territoriality charge is a damning one. There are numerous
instances of Stallman sticking to his guns more out of habit than
out of principle: his initial dismissal of the Linux kernel, for
example, and his current unwillingness as a political figure to
venture outside the realm of software issues.</p>
<p>Then again, as the recent debate over open source also shows, in
instances when Stallman has stuck to his guns, he's usually found a
way to gain ground because of it. "One of Stallman's primary
character traits is the fact he doesn't budge," says Ian Murdock.
"He'll wait up to a decade for people to come around to his point
of view if that's what it takes."</p>
<p>Murdock, for one, finds that unbudgeable nature both refreshing
and valuable. Stallman may no longer be the solitary leader of the
free software movement, but he is still the polestar of the free
software community. "You always know that he's going to be
consistent in his views," Murdock says. "Most people aren't like
that. Whether you agree with him or not, you really have to respect

<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>Finland has a significant (about 6%) Swedish-speaking minority

time brought about by partitioning. Adding more men then lengthens,
not shortens, the schedule.</p></blockquote>
