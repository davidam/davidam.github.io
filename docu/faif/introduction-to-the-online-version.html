<p>The work of Richard M. Stallman literally speaks for itself.
From the documented source code to the published papers to the
recorded speeches, few people have expressed as much willingness to
lay their thoughts and their work on the line.</p>
<p>Such openness--if one can pardon a momentary un-Stallman
adjective--is refreshing. After all, we live in a society that
treats information, especially personal information, as a valuable
commodity. The question quickly arises. Why would anybody want to
part with so much information and yet appear to demand nothing in
return?</p>
<p>As we shall see in later chapters, Stallman does not part with
his words or his work altruistically. Every program, speech, and
on-the-record bon mot comes with a price, albeit not the kind of
price most people are used to paying.</p>
<p>I bring this up not as a warning, but as an admission. As a
person who has spent the last year digging up facts on Stallman's
personal history, it's more than a little intimidating going up
against the Stallman oeuvre. "Never pick a fight with a man who
buys his ink by the barrel," goes the old Mark Twain adage. In the
case of Stallman, never attempt the definitive biography of a man
who trusts his every thought to the public record.</p>
<p>For the readers who have decided to trust a few hours of their
time to exploring this book, I can confidently state that there are
facts and quotes in here that one won't find in any Slashdot story
or Google search. Gaining access to these facts involves paying a
price, however. In the case of the book version, you can pay for
these facts the traditional manner, i.e., by purchasing the book.
In the case of the electronic versions, you can pay for these facts
in the free software manner. Thanks to the folks at O'Reilly &amp;
Associates, this book is being distributed under the GNU Free
Documentation License, meaning you can help to improve the work or
create a personalized version and release that version under the
same license.</p>
<p>If you are reading an electronic version and prefer to accept
the latter payment option, that is, if you want to improve or
expand this book for future readers, I welcome your input. Starting
in June, 2002, I will be publishing a bare bones HTML version of
the book on the web site, http://www.faifzilla.org. My aim is to
update it regularly and expand the [<span class="CITATION">Free as
in Freedom</span>] story as events warrant. If you choose to take
the latter course, please review Appendix C of this book. It
provides a copy of your rights under the GNU Free Documentation
License.</p>
<p>For those who just plan to sit back and read, online or
elsewhere, I consider your attention an equally valuable form of
payment. Don't be surprised, though, if you, too, find yourself
looking for other ways to reward the good will that made this work
possible.</p>
<p>One final note: this is a work of journalism, but it is also a
work of technical documentation. In the process of writing and
editing this book, the editors and I have weighed the comments and
factual input of various participants in the story, including
Richard Stallman himself. We realize there are many technical
details in this story that may benefit from additional or refined
information. As this book is released under the GFDL, we are
accepting patches just like we would with any free software
program. Accepted changes will be posted electronically and will
eventually be incorporated into future printed versions of this
work. If you would like to contribute to the further improvement of
this book, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:sam@inow.com"
