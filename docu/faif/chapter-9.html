<h1><a name="CHAPTER-9">Cap&iacute;tulo 9. La Licencia
P&uacute;blica General GNU</a></h1>
<p>En la primavera de 1985, Richard Stallman se hab&iacute;a
concentrado en el primer gran logro del movimiento GNU: una
versi&oacute;n de Emacs libre basada en Lisp. Para cumplir este
objetivo, sin embargo, deb&iacute;a enfrentarse a dos grandes
retos. En primer lugar, ten&iacute;a que encontrar la manera de
reconstruir Emacs de forma tal que no fuera dependiente de ninguna
plataforma. En segundo, ten&iacute;a que reconstruir la Comuna de
Emacs de manera an&aacute;loga.</p>
<p>La disputa con UniPress hab&iacute;a revelado una debilidad en
el contrato social de la Cumuna de Emacs. A&uacute;nque los
usuarios obten&iacute;an la experiencia y visi&oacute;n de
Stallman, las reglas de la Comuna se impusieron. En &aacute;reas en
las que Stallman no manten&iacute;a su posici&oacute;n de alpha
hacker -en sistemas Unix anteriores a 1984, por ejemplo-, otras
personas y compa&ntilde;&iacute;as ten&iacute;an la libertad de
crear sus propias reglas.</p>
<p>La tensi&oacute;n entre la libertad de modificar y la libertad
de ejercer privilegios autoritarios hab&iacute;a estado creciendo
en el caso de GOSMACS. El Acto de Derechos de Autor de 1976
hab&iacute;a extendido las leyes de derechos de autor en los
Estados Unidos, aumentando su cobertura para incluir los programas
de computador. De acuerdo con la secci&oacute;n 102(b) del Acto, se
les daba a las personas y compa&ntilde;&iacute;as la capacidad de
proteger la "expresi&oacute;n" de un programa pero no los "procesos
o m&eacute;todos utilizados en el programa". <a name="AEN1877"
   href="#FTN.AEN1877">[1]</a> En la pr&aacute;ctica, esto les
   permit&iacute;a a los programadores y a las
   compa&ntilde;&iacute;as tratar los programas de computadores
   como novelas o canciones. Otros programadores podr&iacute;an
   inspirarse en las obras, pero para realizar una copia directa o
   una obra derivada (que no fuera de naturaleza sat&iacute;rica)
   tendr&iacute;an que obtener un permiso expl&iacute;cito del
   autor. Aunque la nueva legislaci&oacute;n garantizaba que
   a&uacute;n programas sin advertencias de reservas sobre los
   derechos de autor se ve&iacute;an protegidos, los programadores
   no tardaron en asegurar sus derechos, adjuntando advertencias al
   respecto a sus programas.</p>
<p>Al principio, Stallman reaccion&oacute; alarmado a estas
advertencia. En esa &eacute;poca eran poco comunes los programas
que no compartieran c&oacute;digo fuente con otros. bast&oacute;
una simple firma del presidente para que el congreso les diera a
los programadores y compa&ntilde;&iacute;as el poder de asegurar su
propiedad individual sobre programas creados por comunidades.
Adem&aacute;s se inyect&oacute; una dosis de formalidad en un
sistema que hab&iacute;a sido siempre muy informal. A&uacute;n si
los hackers pudiesen haber demostrado que el c&oacute;digo fuente
de un programa determinado proven&iacute;a de a&ntilde;os o
d&eacute;cadas de trabajo, no ten&iacute;an los recursos y el
dinero que hubieran requerido para combatir estas advertencias de
derechos de autor. Resumiendo, estas disputas que antes
hab&iacute;an sido arregladas entre hackers ahora tendr&iacute;an
que ser resueltas por abogados. As&iacute; las cosas, las
compa&ntilde;&iacute;as, no los hackers, ten&iacute;an una gran
ventaja.</p>
<p>&#13; Los promotores de los derechos de autor en el software
ten&iacute;an sus propios argumentos: sin derechos de autor, las
obras pasar&iacute;an directamente al dominio p&uacute;blico.
Colocar una advertencia de derechos de autor en una obra
tambi&eacute;n serv&iacute;a como una muestra de calidad. Los
programadores o compa&ntilde;&iacute;as que colocaban sus nombres
en estas advertencias colocaban tambi&eacute;n su
reputaci&oacute;n. Finalmente, Proponents of software copyright had
their counter-arguments: without copyright, works might otherwise
slip into the public domain. Putting a copyright notice on a work
also served as a statement of quality. Programmers or companies who
attached their name to the copyright attached their reputations as
well. Finally, it was a contract, as well as a statement of
ownership. Using copyright as a flexible form of license, an author
could give away certain rights in exchange for certain forms of
behavior on the part of the user. For example, an author could give
away the right to suppress unauthorized copies just so long as the
end user agreed not to create a commercial offshoot.</p>
<p>It was this last argument that eventually softened Stallman's
resistance to software copyright notices. Looking back on the years
leading up to the GNU Project, Stallman says he began to sense the
beneficial nature of copyright sometime around the release of Emacs
15.0, the last significant pre-GNU Project upgrade of Emacs. "I had
seen email messages with copyright notices plus simple `verbatim
copying permitted' licenses," Stallman recalls. "Those definitely
were [an] inspiration."</p>
<p>For Emacs 15, Stallman drafted a copyright that gave users the
right to make and distribute copies. It also gave users the right
to make modified versions, but not the right to claim sole
ownership of those modified versions, as in the case of
GOSMACS.</p>
<p>Although helpful in codifying the social contract of the Emacs
Commune, the Emacs 15 license remained too "informal" for the
purposes of the GNU Project, Stallman says. Soon after starting
work on a GNU version of Emacs, Stallman began consulting with the
other members of the Free Software Foundation on how to shore up
the license's language. He also consulted with the attorneys who
had helped him set up the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p>Mark Fischer, a Boston attorney specializing in
intellectual-property law, recalls discussing the license with
Stallman during this period. "Richard had very strong views about
how it should work," Fischer says, "He had two principles. The
first was to make the software absolutely as open as possible. The
second was to encourage others to adopt the same licensing
practices."</p>
<p>Encouraging others to adopt the same licensing practices meant
closing off the escape hatch that had allowed privately owned
versions of Emacs to emerge. To close that escape hatch, Stallman
and his free software colleagues came up with a solution: users
would be free to modify GNU Emacs just so long as they published
their modifications. In addition, the resulting "derivative" works
would also have carry the same GNU Emacs License.</p>
<p>The revolutionary nature of this final condition would take a
while to sink in. At the time, Fischer says, he simply viewed the
GNU Emacs License as a simple contract. It put a price tag on GNU
Emacs' use. Instead of money, Stallman was charging users access to
their own later modifications. That said, Fischer does remember the
contract terms as unique.</p>
<p>"I think asking other people to accept the price was, if not
unique, highly unusual at that time," he says.</p>
<p>The GNU Emacs License made its debut when Stallman finally
released GNU Emacs in 1985. Following the release, Stallman
welcomed input from the general hacker community on how to improve
the license's language. One hacker to take up the offer was future
software activist John Gilmore, then working as a consultant to Sun
Microsystems. As part of his consulting work, Gilmore had ported
Emacs over to SunOS, the company's in-house version of Unix. In the
process of doing so, Gilmore had published the changes as per the
demands of the GNU Emacs License. Instead of viewing the license as
a liability, Gilmore saw it as clear and concise expression of the
hacker ethos. "Up until then, most licenses were very informal,"
Gilmore recalls.</p>
<p>As an example of this informality, Gilmore cites a copyright
notice for trn, a Unix utility. Written by Larry Wall, future
creator of the Perl programming language, patch made it simple for
Unix programmers to insert source-code fixes--"patches" in hacker
jargon--into any large program. Recognizing the utility of this
feature, Wall put the following copyright notice in the program's
accompanying README file:</p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN">
<font color=
"#000000">Copyright (c) 1985, Larry Wall You may copy the trn
    kit in whole or in part as long as you don't try to make money off
    it, or pretend that you wrote it.
<a name="AEN1922" href="#FTN.AEN1922">[2]</a>
</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br>
<br>
<p>Such statements, while reflective of the hacker ethic, also
reflected the difficulty of translating the loose, informal nature
of that ethic into the rigid, legal language of copyright. In
writing the GNU Emacs License, Stallman had done more than close up
the escape hatch that permitted proprietary offshoots. He had
expressed the hacker ethic in a manner understandable to both
lawyer and hacker alike.</p>
<p>It wasn't long, Gilmore says, before other hackers began
discussing ways to "port" the GNU Emacs License over to their own
programs. Prompted by a conversation on Usenet, Gilmore sent an
email to Stallman in November, 1986, suggesting modification:</p>
<a name="AEN1926"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>You should probably remove "EMACS" from the license and replace
it with "SOFTWARE" or something. Soon, we hope, Emacs will not be
the biggest part of the GNU system, and the license applies to all
of it. <a name="AEN1928" href=
"#FTN.AEN1928">[3]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Gilmore wasn't the only person suggesting a more general
approach. By the end of 1986, Stallman himself was at work with GNU
Project's next major milestone, a source-code debugger, and was
looking for ways to revamp the Emacs license so that it might apply
to both programs. Stallman's solution: remove all specific
references to Emacs and convert the license into a generic
copyright umbrella for GNU Project software. The GNU General Public
License, GPL for short, was born.</p>
<p>In fashioning the GPL, Stallman followed the software convention
of using decimal numbers to indicate prototype versions and whole
numbers to indicate mature versions. Stallman published Version 1.0
of the GPL in 1989 (a project Stallman was developing in 1985),
almost a full year after the release of the GNU Debugger,
Stallman's second major foray into the realm of Unix programming.
The license contained a preamble spelling out its political
intentions:</p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN">
<font color=
"#000000">The General Public License is designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.
<a name="AEN1940" href="#FTN.AEN1940">[4]</a>
</font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br>
<br>
<p>In fashioning the GPL, Stallman had been forced to make an
additional adjustment to the informal tenets of the old Emacs
Commune. Where he had once demanded that Commune members publish
any and all changes, Stallman now demanded publication only in
instances when programmers circulated their derivative versions in
the same public manner as Stallman. In other words, programmers who
simply modified Emacs for private use no longer needed to send the
source-code changes back to Stallman. In what would become a rare
compromise of free software doctrine, Stallman slashed the price
tag for free software. Users could innovate without Stallman
looking over their shoulders just so long as they didn't bar
Stallman and the rest of the hacker community from future exchanges
of the same program.</p>
<p>Looking back, Stallman says the GPL compromise was fueled by his
own dissatisfaction with the Big Brother aspect of the original
Emacs Commune social contract. As much as he liked peering into
other hackers' systems, the knowledge that some future source-code
maintainer might use that power to ill effect forced him to temper
the GPL.</p>
<p>"It was wrong to require people to publish all changes," says
Stallman. "It was wrong to require them to be sent to one
privileged developer. That kind of centralization and privilege for
one was not consistent with a society in which all had equal
rights."</p>
<p>As hacks go, the GPL stands as one of Stallman's best. It
created a system of communal ownership within the normally
proprietary confines of copyright law. More importantly, it
demonstrated the intellectual similarity between legal code and
software code. Implicit within the GPL's preamble was a profound
message: instead of viewing copyright law with suspicion, hackers
should view it as yet another system begging to be hacked.</p>
<p>"The GPL developed much like any piece of free software with a
large community discussing its structure, its respect or the
opposite in their observation, needs for tweaking and even to
compromise it mildly for greater acceptance," says Jerry Cohen,
another attorney who helped Stallman with the creation of the
license. "The process worked very well and GPL in its several
versions has gone from widespread skeptical and at times hostile
response to widespread acceptance."</p>
<p>In a 1986 interview with [<span class="CITATION">Byte</span>]
magazine, Stallman summed up the GPL in colorful terms. In addition
to proclaiming hacker values, Stallman said, readers should also
"see it as a form of intellectual jujitsu, using the legal system
that software hoarders have set up against them." <a name="AEN1951"
href="#FTN.AEN1951">[5]</a> Years later, Stallman would describe
the GPL's creation in less hostile terms. "I was thinking about
issues that were in a sense ethical and in a sense political and in
a sense legal," he says. "I had to try to do what could be
sustained by the legal system that we're in. In spirit the job was
that of legislating the basis for a new society, but since I wasn't
a government, I couldn't actually change any laws. I had to try to
do this by building on top of the existing legal system, which had
not been designed for anything like this."</p>
<p>About the time Stallman was pondering the ethical, political,
and legal issues associated with free software, a California hacker
named Don Hopkins mailed him a manual for the 68000 microprocessor.
Hopkins, a Unix hacker and fellow science-fiction buff, had
borrowed the manual from Stallman a while earlier. As a display of
gratitude, Hopkins decorated the return envelope with a number of
stickers obtained at a local science-fiction convention. One
sticker in particular caught Stallman's eye. It read, "Copyleft
(L), All Rights Reversed." Following the release of the first
version of GPL, Stallman paid tribute to the sticker, nicknaming
the free software license "Copyleft." Over time, the nickname and
its shorthand symbol, a backwards "C," would become an official
Free Software Foundation synonym for the GPL.</p>
<p>The German sociologist Max Weber once proposed that all great
religions are built upon the "routinization" or
"institutionalization" of charisma. Every successful religion,
Weber argued, converts the charisma or message of the original
religious leader into a social, political, and ethical apparatus
more easily translatable across cultures and time.</p>
<p>While not religious per se, the GNU GPL certainly qualifies as
an interesting example of this "routinization" process at work in
the modern, decentralized world of software development. Since its
unveiling, programmers and companies who have otherwise expressed
little loyalty or allegiance to Stallman have willingly accepted
the GPL bargain at face value. A few have even accepted the GPL as
a preemptive protective mechanism for their own software programs.
Even those who reject the GPL contract as too compulsory, still
credit it as influential.</p>
<p>One hacker falling into this latter group was Keith Bostic, a
University of California employee at the time of the GPL 1.0
release. Bostic's department, the Computer Systems Research Group
(SRG), had been involved in Unix development since the late 1970s
and was responsible for many key parts of Unix, including the
TCP/IP networking protocol, the cornerstone of modern Internet
communications. By the late 1980s, AT&amp;T, the original owner of
the Unix brand name, began to focus on commercializing Unix and
began looking to the Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD, the
academic version of Unix developed by Bostic and his Berkeley
peers, as a key source of commercial technology.</p>
<p>Although the Berkeley BSD source code was shared among
researchers and commercial programmers with a source-code license,
this commercialization presented a problem. The Berkeley code was
intermixed with proprietary AT&amp;T code. As a result, Berkeley
distributions were available only to institutions that already had
a Unix source license from AT&amp;T. As AT&amp;T raised its license
fees, this arrangement, which had at first seemed innocuous, became
increasingly burdensome.</p>
<p>Hired in 1986, Bostic had taken on the personal project of
porting BSD over to the Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-11
computer. It was during this period, Bostic says, that he came into
close interaction with Stallman during Stallman's occasional forays
out to the west coast. "I remember vividly arguing copyright with
Stallman while he sat at borrowed workstations at CSRG," says
Bostic. "We'd go to dinner afterward and continue arguing about
copyright over dinner."</p>
<p>The arguments eventually took hold, although not in the way
Stallman would have liked. In June, 1989, Berkeley separated its
networking code from the rest of the AT&amp;T-owned operating
system and distributed it under a University of California license.
The contract terms were liberal. All a licensee had to do was give
credit to the university in advertisements touting derivative
programs. <a name="AEN1988" href="#FTN.AEN1988">[6]</a> In contrast
to the GPL, proprietary offshoots were permissible. Only one
problem hampered the license's rapid adoption: the BSD Networking
release wasn't a complete operating system. People could study the
code, but it could only be run in conjunction with other
proprietary-licensed code.</p>
<p>Over the next few years, Bostic and other University of
California employees worked to replace the missing components and
turn BSD into a complete, freely redistributable operating system.
Although delayed by a legal challenge from Unix Systems
Laboratories--the AT&amp;T spin-off that retained ownership of the
Unix brand name--the effort would finally bear fruit in the early
1990s. Even before then, however, many of the Berkeley utilities
would make their way into Stallman's GNU Project.</p>
<p>"I think it's highly unlikely that we ever would have gone as
strongly as we did without the GNU influence," says Bostic, looking
back. "It was clearly something where they were pushing hard and we
liked the idea."</p>
<p>By the end of the 1980s, the GPL was beginning to exert a
gravitational effect on the free software community. A program
didn't have to carry the GPL to qualify as free software-witness
the case of the BSD utilities--but putting a program under the GPL
sent a definite message. "I think the very existence of the GPL
inspired people to think through whether they were making free
software, and how they would license it," says Bruce Perens,
creator of Electric Fence, a popular Unix utility, and future
leader of the Debian GNU/Linux development team. A few years after
the release of the GPL, Perens says he decided to discard Electric
Fence's homegrown license in favor of Stallman's lawyer-vetted
copyright. "It was actually pretty easy to do," Perens recalls.</p>
<p>Rich Morin, the programmer who had viewed Stallman's initial GNU
announcement with a degree of skepticism, recalls being impressed
by the software that began to gather under the GPL umbrella. As the
leader of a SunOS user group, one of Morin's primary duties during
the 1980s had been to send out distribution tapes containing the
best freeware or free software utilities. The job often mandated
calling up original program authors to verify whether their
programs were copyright protected or whether they had been
consigned to the public domain. Around 1989, Morin says, he began
to notice that the best software programs typically fell under the
GPL license. "As a software distributor, as soon as I saw the word
GPL, I knew I was home free," recalls Morin.</p>
<p>To compensate for the prior hassles that went into compiling
distribution tapes to the Sun User Group, Morin had charged
recipients a convenience fee. Now, with programs moving over to the
GPL, Morin was suddenly getting his tapes put together in half the
time, turning a tidy profit in the process. Sensing a commercial
opportunity, Morin rechristened his hobby as a business: Prime Time
Freeware.</p>
<p>Such commercial exploitation was completely within the confines
of the free software agenda. "When we speak of free software, we
are referring to freedom, not price," advised Stallman in the GPL's
preamble. By the late 1980s, Stallman had refined it to a more
simple mnemonic: "Don't think free as in free beer; think free as
in free speech."</p>
<p>For the most part, businesses ignored Stallman's entreaties.
Still, for a few entrepreneurs, the freedom associated with free
software was the same freedom associated with free markets. Take
software ownership out of the commercial equation, and you had a
situation where even the smallest software company was free to
compete against the IBMs and DECs of the world.</p>
<p>One of the first entrepreneurs to grasp this concept was Michael
Tiemann, a software programmer and graduate student at Stanford
University. During the 1980s, Tiemann had followed the GNU Project
like an aspiring jazz musician following a favorite artist. It
wasn't until the release of the GNU C Compiler in 1987, however,
that he began to grasp the full potential of free software. Dubbing
GCC a "bombshell," Tiemann says the program's own existence
underlined Stallman's determination as a programmer.</p>
<p>"Just as every writer dreams of writing the great American
novel, every programmer back in the 1980s talked about writing the
great American compiler," Tiemman recalls. "Suddenly Stallman had
done it. It was very humbling."</p>
<p>"You talk about single points of failure, GCC was it," echoes
Bostic. "Nobody had a compiler back then, until GCC came
along."</p>
<p>Rather than compete with Stallman, Tiemann decided to build on
top of his work. The original version of GCC weighed in at 110,000
lines of code, but Tiemann recalls the program as surprisingly easy
to understand. So easy in fact that Tiemann says it took less than
five days to master and another week to port the software to a new
hardware platform, National Semiconductor's 32032 microchip. Over
the next year, Tiemann began playing around with the source code,
creating a native compiler for the C+ programming language. One
day, while delivering a lecture on the program at Bell Labs,
Tiemann ran into some AT&amp;T developers struggling to pull off
the same thing.</p>
<p>"There were about 40 or 50 people in the room, and I asked how
many people were working on the native code compiler," Tiemann
recalls. "My host said the information was confidential but added
that if I took a look around the room I might get a good general
idea."</p>
<p>It wasn't long after, Tiemann says, that the light bulb went off
in his head. "I had been working on that project for six months,"
Tiemann says. "I just thought to myself, whether it's me or the
code this is a level of efficiency that the free market should be
ready to reward."</p>
<p>Tiemann found added inspiration in the GNU Manifesto, which,
while excoriating the greed of some software vendors, encourages
other vendors to consider the advantages of free software from a
consumer point of view. By removing the power of monopoly from the
commerical software question, the GPL makes it possible for the
smartest vendors to compete on the basis of service and consulting,
the two most profit-rich corners of the software marketplace.</p>
<p>In a 1999 essay, Tiemann recalls the impact of Stallman's
Manifesto. "It read like a socialist polemic, but I saw something
different. I saw a business plan in disguise." <a name="AEN2025"
href="#FTN.AEN2025">[7]</a></p>
<p>Teaming up with John Gilmore, another GNU Project fan, Tiemann
launched a software consulting service dedicated to customizing GNU
programs. Dubbed Cygnus Support, the company signed its first
development contract in February, 1990. By the end of the year, the
company had $725,000 worth of support and development
contracts.</p>
<p>GNU Emacs, GDB, and GCC were the "big three" of
developer-oriented tools, but they weren't the only ones developed
by Stallman during the GNU Project's first half decade. By 1990,
Stallman had also generated GNU versions of the Bourne Shell
(rechristened the Bourne Again Shell, or BASH), YACC (rechristened
Bison), and awk (rechristened gawk). Like GCC, every GNU program
had to be designed to run on multiple systems, not just a single
vendor's platform. In the process of making programs more flexible,
Stallman and his collaborators often made them more useful as
well.</p>
<p>Recalling the GNU universalist approach, Prime Time Freeware's
Morin points to a critical, albeit mundane, software package called
hello. "It's the hello world program which is five lines of C,
packaged up as if it were a GNU distribution," Morin says. "And so
it's got the Texinfo stuff and the configure stuff. It's got all
the other software engineering goo that the GNU Project has come up
with to allow packages to port to all these different environments
smoothly. That's tremendously important work, and it affects not
only all of [Stallman's] software, but also all of the other GNU
Project software."</p>
<p>According to Stallman, improving software programs was secondary
to building them in the first place. "With each piece I may or may
not find a way to improve it," said Stallman to [<span class=
"CITATION">Byte</span>]. "To some extent I am getting the benefit
of reimplementation, which makes many systems much better. To some
extent it's because I have been in the field a long time and worked
on many other systems. I therefore have many ideas to bring to
bear." <a name="AEN2035" href="#FTN.AEN2035">[8]</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, as GNU tools made their mark in the late 1980s,
Stallman's AI Lab-honed reputation for design fastidiousness soon
became legendary throughout the entire software-development
community.</p>
<p>Jeremy Allison, a Sun user during the late 1980s and programmer
destined to run his own free software project, Samba, in the 1990s,
recalls that reputation with a laugh. During the late 1980s,
Allison began using Emacs. Inspired by the program's
community-development model, Allison says he sent in a snippet of
source code only to have it rejected by Stallman.</p>
<p>"It was like the [<span class="CITATION">Onion</span>]
headline," Allison says. "`Child's prayers to God answered:
No.'"</p>
<p>Stallman's growing stature as a software programmer, however,
was balanced by his struggles as a project manager. Although the
GNU Project moved from success to success in creation of
developer-oriented tools, its inability to generate a working
kernel--the central "traffic cop" program in all Unix systems that
determines which devices and applications get access to the
microprocessor and when--was starting to elicit grumbles as the
1980s came to a close. As with most GNU Project efforts, Stallman
had started kernel development by looking for an existing program
to modify. According to a January 1987 "Gnusletter," Stallman was
already working to overhaul TRIX, a Unix kernel developed at
MIT.</p>
<p>A review of GNU Project "GNUsletters" of the late 1980s reflects
the management tension. In January, 1987, Stallman announced to the
world that the GNU Project was working to overhaul TRIX, a Unix
kernel developed at MIT. A year later, in February of 1988, the GNU
Project announced that it had shifted its attentions to Mach, a
lightweight "micro-kernel" developed at Carnegie Mellon. All told,
however, official GNU Project kernel development wouldn't commence
until 1990. <a name="AEN2050" href="#FTN.AEN2050">[9]</a></p>
<p>The delays in kernel development were just one of many concerns
weighing on Stallman during this period. In 1989, Lotus Development
Corporation filed suit against rival software company, Paperback
Software International, for copying menu commands in Lotus' popular
1-2-3 Spreadsheet program. Lotus' suit, coupled with the
Apple-Microsoft "look and feel" battle, provided a troublesome
backdrop for the GNU Project. Although both suits fell outside the
scope of the GNU Project, both revolved around operating systems
and software applications developed for the personal computer, not
Unix-compatible hardware systems--they threatened to impose a
chilling effect on the entire culture of software development.
Determined to do something, Stallman recruited a few programmer
friends and composed a magazine ad blasting the lawsuits. He then
followed up the ad by helping to organize a group to protest the
corporations filing the suit. Calling itself the League of
Programming Freedom, the group held protests outside the offices of
Lotus, Inc. and the Boston courtroom hosting the Lotus trial.</p>
<p>The protests were notable. <a name="AEN2062" href=
"#FTN.AEN2062">[10]</a> They document the evolving nature of
software industry. Applications had quietly replaced operating
systems as the primary corporate battleground. In its unfulfilled
quest to build a free software operating system, the GNU Project
seemed hopelessly behind the times. Indeed, the very fact that
Stallman had felt it necessary to put together an entirely new
group dedicated to battling the "look and feel" lawsuits reinforced
that obsolescence in the eyes of some observers.</p>
<p>In 1990, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation
cerified Stallman's genius status when it granted Stallman a
MacArthur fellowship, therefore making him a recipient for the
organization's so-called "genius grant." The grant, a $240,000
reward for launching the GNU Project and giving voice to the free
software philosophy, relieved a number of short-term concerns.
First and foremost, it gave Stallman, a nonsalaried employee of the
FSF who had been supporting himself through consulting contracts,
the ability to devote more time to writing GNU code. <a name=
"AEN2066" href="#FTN.AEN2066">[11]</a></p>
<p>Ironically, the award also made it possible for Stallman to
vote. Months before the award, a fire in Stallman's apartment house
had consumed his few earthly possessions. By the time of the award,
Stallman was listing himself as a "squatter" <a name="AEN2069"
   href="#FTN.AEN2069">[12]</a> at 545 Technology Square. "[The
   registrar of voters] didn't want to accept that as my address,"
   Stallman would later recall. "A newspaper article about the
   MacArthur grant said that and then they let me register."
   <a name="AEN2072" href="#FTN.AEN2072">[13]</a></p>
<p>Most importantly, the MacArthur money gave Stallman more
freedom. Already dedicated to the issue of software freedom,
Stallman chose to use the additional freedom to increase his
travels in support of the GNU Project mission.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the ultimate success of the GNU Project and the
free software movement in general would stem from one of these
trips. In 1990, Stallman paid a visit to the Polytechnic University
in Helsinki, Finland. Among the audience members was 21-year-old
Linus Torvalds, future developer of the Linux kernel-the free
software kernel destined to fill the GNU Project's most sizable
gap.</p>
<p>A student at the nearby University of Helsinki at the time,
Torvalds regarded Stallman with bemusement. "I saw, for the first
time in my life, the stereotypical long-haired, bearded hacker
type," recalls Torvalds in his 2001 autobiography
      [<span class="CITATION">Just for Fun</span>]. "We don't have
      much of them in Helsinki." <a name="AEN2085" href=
      "#FTN.AEN2085">[14]</a></p>
<p>While not exactly attuned to the "sociopolitical" side of the
Stallman agenda, Torvalds nevertheless appreciated the agenda's
underlying logic: no programmer writes error-free code. By sharing
software, hackers put a program's improvement ahead of individual
motivations such as greed or ego protection.</p>
<p>Like many programmers of his generation, Torvalds had cut his
teeth not on mainframe computers like the IBM 7094, but on a motley
assortment of home-built computer systems. As university student,
Torvalds had made the step up from C programming to Unix, using the
university's MicroVAX. This ladder-like progression had given
Torvalds a different perspective on the barriers to machine access.
For Stallman, the chief barriers were bureaucracy and privilege.
For Torvalds, the chief barriers were geography and the harsh
Helsinki winter. Forced to trek across the University of Helsinki
just to log in to his Unix account, Torvalds quickly began looking
for a way to log in from the warm confines of his off-campus
apartment.</p>
<p>The search led Torvalds to the operating system Minix, a
lightweight version of Unix developed for instructional purposes by
Dutch university professor Andrew Tanenbaum. The program fit within
the memory confines of a 386 PC, the most powerful machine Torvalds
could afford, but still lacked a few necessary features. It most
notably lacked terminal emulation, the feature that allowed
Torvalds' machine to mimic a university terminal, making it
possible to log in to the MicroVAX from home.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1991, Torvalds rewrote Minix from the
ground up, adding other features as he did so. By the end of the
summer, Torvalds was referring to his evolving work as the
"GNU/Emacs of terminal emulation programs." <a name="AEN2107"
   href="#FTN.AEN2107">[15]</a> Feeling confident, he solicited a
   Minix newsgroup for copies of the POSIX standards, the software
   blue prints that determined whether a program was Unix
   compatible. A few weeks later, Torvalds was posting a message
   eerily reminiscent of Stallman's original 1983 GNU posting:</p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre class="SCREEN">
<font color="#000000">Hello everybody out there using minix-

    I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big
    and professional like gnu for 386 (486) AT clones). This has been
    brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any
    feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS
    resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system
    (due to practical reasons) among other things).
<a name="AEN2112" href="#FTN.AEN2112">[16]</a> </font>
</pre></td></tr></table>
<br>
<br>
<p>The posting drew a smattering of responses and within a month,
Torvalds had posted a 0.01 version of the operating system--i.e.,
the earliest possible version fit for outside review--on an
Internet FTP site. In the course of doing so, Torvalds had to come
up with a name for the new system. On his own PC hard drive,
Torvalds had saved the program as Linux, a name that paid its
respects to the software convention of giving each Unix variant a
name that ended with the letter X. Deeming the name too
"egotistical," Torvalds changed it to Freax, only to have the FTP
site manager change it back.</p>
<p>Although Torvalds had set out build a full operating system,
both he and other developers knew at the time that most of the
functional tools needed to do so were already available, thanks to
the work of GNU, BSD, and other free software developers. One of
the first tools the Linux development team took advantage of was
the GNU C Compiler, a tool that made it possible to process
programs written in the C programming language.</p>
<p>Integrating GCC improved the performance of Linux. It also
raised issues. Although the GPL's "viral" powers didn't apply to
the Linux kernel, Torvald's willingness to borrow GCC for the
purposes of his own free software operating system indicated a
certain obligation to let other users borrow back. As Torvalds
would later put it: "I had hoisted myself up on the shoulders of
giants." <a name="AEN2125" href="#FTN.AEN2125">[17]</a> Not
surprisingly, he began to think about what would happen when other
people looked to him for similar support. A decade after the
decision, Torvalds echoes the Free Software Foundation's Robert
Chassel when he sums up his thoughts at the time:</p>
<a name="AEN2128"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>You put six months of your life into this thing and you want to
make it available and you want to get something out of it, but you
don't want people to take advantage of it. I wanted people to be
able to see [Linux], and to make changes and improvements to their
hearts' content. But I also wanted to make sure that what I got out
of it was to see what they were doing. I wanted to always have
access to the sources so that if they made improvements, I could
make those improvements myself. <a name="AEN2130" href=
"#FTN.AEN2130">[18]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>When it was time to release the 0.12 version of Linux, the first
to include a fully integrated version of GCC, Torvalds decided to
voice his allegiance with the free software movement. He discarded
the old kernel license and replaced it with the GPL. The decision
triggered a porting spree, as Torvalds and his collaborators looked
to other GNU programs to fold into the growing Linux stew. Within
three years, Linux developers were offering their first production
release, Linux 1.0, including fully modified versions of GCC, GDB,
and a host of BSD tools.</p>
<p>By 1994, the amalgamated operating system had earned enough
respect in the hacker world to make some observers wonder if
Torvalds hadn't given away the farm by switching to the GPL in the
project's initial months. In the first issue of Linux Journal,
publisher Robert Young sat down with Torvalds for an interview.
When Young asked the Finnish programmer if he felt regret at giving
up private ownership of the Linux source code, Torvalds said no.
"Even with 20/20 hindsight," Torvalds said, he considered the GPL
"one of the very best design decisions" made during the early
stages of the Linux project. <a name="AEN2135" href=
"#FTN.AEN2135">[19]</a></p>
<p>That the decision had been made with zero appeal or deference to
Stallman and the Free Software Foundation speaks to the GPL's
growing portability. Although it would take a few years to be
recognized by Stallman, the explosiveness of Linux development
conjured flashbacks of Emacs. This time around, however, the
innovation triggering the explosion wasn't a software hack like
Control-R but the novelty of running a Unix-like system on the PC
architecture. The motives may have been different, but the end
result certainly fit the ethical specifications: a fully functional
operating system composed entirely of free software.</p>
<p>As his initial email message to the comp.os.minix newsgroup
indicates, it would take a few months before Torvalds saw Linux as
anything less than a holdover until the GNU developers delivered on
the HURD kernel. This initial unwillingness to see Linux in
political terms would represent a major blow to the Free Software
Foundation.</p>
<p>As far as Torvalds was concerned, he was simply the latest in a
long line of kids taking apart and reassembling things just for
fun. Nevertheless, when summing up the runaway success of a project
that could have just as easily spent the rest of its days on an
abandoned computer hard drive, Torvalds credits his younger self
for having the wisdom to give up control and accept the GPL
bargain.</p>
<p>"I may not have seen the light," writes Torvalds, reflecting on
Stallman's 1991 Polytechnic University speech and his subsequent
decision to switch to the GPL. "But I guess something from his
speech sunk in." <a name="AEN2144" href=

editors," [<span class="CITATION">BYTE</span>] (July, 1996).
(Reprinted on the GNU Project web site:
http://www.gnu.org/gnu/byte-interview.html.) This interview offers
an interesting, not to mention candid, glimpse at Stallman's
political attitudes during the earliest days of the GNU Project. It
is also helpful in tracing the evolution of Stallman's rhetoric.
Describing the purpose of the GPL, Stallman says, "I'm trying to
change the way people approach knowledge and information in
general. I think that to try to own knowledge, to try to control
whether people are allowed to use it, or to try to stop other
people from sharing it, is sabotage." Contrast this with a
statement to the author in August 2000: "I urge you not to use the
term `intellectual property' in your thinking. It will lead you to
misunderstand things, because that term generalizes about
copyrights, patents, and trademarks. And those things are so
different in their effects that it is entirely foolish to try to
talk about them at once. If you hear somebody saying something
about intellectual property, without quotes, then he's not thinking
very clearly and you shouldn't join."</p></td></tr>

<p>The University of California's "obnoxious advertising clause"
would later prove to be a problem. Looking for a less restrictive
alternative to the GPL, some hackers used the University of
California, replacing "University of California" with the name of
their own instution. The result: free software programs that
borrowed from dozens of other programs would have to cite dozens of
institutions in advertisements. In 1999, after a decade of lobbying
on Stallman's part, the University of California agreed to drop
this clause. See "The BSD License Problem" at

<p>I use the term "writing" here loosely. About the time of the
MacArthur award, Stallman began suffering chronic pain in his hands
and was dictating his work to FSF-employed typists. Although some
have speculated that the hand pain was the result of repetitive
stress injury, or RSI, an injury common among software programmers,
Stallman is not 100% sure. "It was NOT carpal tunnel syndrome," he
writes. "My hand problem was in the hands themselves, not in the
wrists." Stallman has since learned to work without typists after
switching to a keyboard with a lighter touch.</p></td></tr>
