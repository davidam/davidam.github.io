<h1><a name="APPENDIX-B">Ap&eacute;ndice B. Hack, Hackers, and
Hacking</a></h1>
<p>To understand the full meaning of the word "hacker," it helps to
examine the word's etymology over the years.</p>
<p>[<span class="CITATION">The New Hacker Dictionary</span>], an
online compendium of software-programmer jargon, officially lists
nine different connotations of the word "hack" and a similar number
for "hacker." Then again, the same publication also includes an
accompanying essay that quotes Phil Agre, an MIT hacker who warns
readers not to be fooled by the word's perceived flexibility. "Hack
has only one meaning," argues Agre. "An extremely subtle and
profound one which defies articulation."</p>
<p>Regardless of the width or narrowness of the definition, most
modern hackers trace the word back to MIT, where the term bubbled
up as popular item of student jargon in the early 1950s. In 1990
the MIT Museum put together a journal documenting the hacking
phenomenon. According to the journal, students who attended the
institute during the fifties used the word "hack" the way a modern
student might use the word "goof." Hanging a jalopy out a dormitory
window was a "hack," but anything harsh or malicious--e.g., egging
a rival dorm's windows or defacing a campus statue--fell outside
the bounds. Implicit within the definition of "hack" was a spirit
of harmless, creative fun.</p>
<p>This spirit would inspire the word's gerund form: "hacking." A
1950s student who spent the better part of the afternoon talking on
the phone or dismantling a radio might describe the activity as
"hacking." Again, a modern speaker would substitute the verb form
of "goof"--"goofing" or "goofing off"--to describe the same
activity.</p>
<p>As the 1950s progressed, the word "hack" acquired a sharper,
more rebellious edge. The MIT of the 1950s was overly competitive,
and hacking emerged as both a reaction to and extension of that
competitive culture. Goofs and pranks suddenly became a way to blow
off steam, thumb one's nose at campus administration, and indulge
creative thinking and behavior stifled by the Institute's rigorous
undergraduate curriculum. With its myriad hallways and underground
steam tunnels, the Institute offered plenty of exploration
opportunities for the student undaunted by locked doors and "No
Trespassing" signs. Students began to refer to their off-limits
explorations as "tunnel hacking." Above ground, the campus phone
system offered similar opportunities. Through casual
experimentation and due diligence, students learned how to perform
humorous tricks. Drawing inspiration from the more traditional
pursuit of tunnel hacking, students quickly dubbed this new
activity "phone hacking."</p>
<p>The combined emphasis on creative play and restriction-free
exploration would serve as the basis for the future mutations of
the hacking term. The first self-described computer hackers of the
1960s MIT campus originated from a late 1950s student group called
the Tech Model Railroad Club. A tight clique within the club was
the Signals and Power (S&amp;P) Committee--the group behind the
railroad club's electrical circuitry system. The system was a
sophisticated assortment of relays and switches similar to the kind
that controlled the local campus phone system. To control it, a
member of the group simply dialed in commands via a connected phone
and watched the trains do his bidding.</p>
<p>The nascent electrical engineers responsible for building and
maintaining this system saw their activity as similar in spirit to
phone hacking. Adopting the hacking term, they began refining it
even further. From the S&amp;P hacker point of view, using one less
relay to operate a particular stretch of track meant having one
more relay for future play. Hacking subtly shifted from a synonym
for idle play to a synonym for idle play that improved the overall
performance or efficiency of the club's railroad system at the same
time. Soon S&amp;P committee members proudly referred to the entire
activity of improving and reshaping the track's underlying
circuitry as "hacking" and to the people who did it as
"hackers."</p>
<p>Given their affinity for sophisticated electronics--not to
mention the traditional MIT-student disregard for closed doors and
"No Trespassing" signs--it didn't take long before the hackers
caught wind of a new machine on campus. Dubbed the TX-0, the
machine was one of the first commercially marketed computers. By
the end of the 1950s, the entire S&amp;P clique had migrated en
masse over to the TX-0 control room, bringing the spirit of
creative play with them. The wide-open realm of computer
programming would encourage yet another mutation in etymology. "To
hack" no longer meant soldering unusual looking circuits, but
cobbling together software programs with little regard to
"official" methods or software-writing procedures. It also meant
improving the efficiency and speed of already-existing programs
that tended to hog up machine resources. True to the word's roots,
it also meant writing programs that served no other purpose than to
amuse or entertain.</p>
<p>A classic example of this expanded hacking definition is the
game Spacewar, the first interactive video game. Developed by MIT
hackers in the early 1960s, Spacewar had all the traditional
hacking definitions: it was goofy and random, serving little useful
purpose other than providing a nightly distraction for the dozen or
so hackers who delighted in playing it. From a software
perspective, however, it was a monumental testament to innovation
of programming skill. It was also completely free. Because hackers
had built it for fun, they saw no reason to guard their creation,
sharing it extensively with other programmers. By the end of the
1960s, Spacewar had become a favorite diversion for mainframe
programmers around the world.</p>
<p>This notion of collective innovation and communal software
ownership distanced the act of computer hacking in the 1960s from
the tunnel hacking and phone hacking of the 1950s. The latter
pursuits tended to be solo or small-group activities. Tunnel and
phone hackers relied heavily on campus lore, but the off-limits
nature of their activity discouraged the open circulation of new
discoveries. Computer hackers, on the other hand, did their work
amid a scientific field biased toward collaboration and the
rewarding of innovation. Hackers and "official" computer scientists
weren't always the best of allies, but in the rapid evolution of
the field, the two species of computer programmer evolved a
cooperative--some might say symbiotic--relationship.</p>
<p>It is a testament to the original computer hackers' prodigious
skill that later programmers, including Richard M. Stallman,
aspired to wear the same hacker mantle. By the mid to late 1970s,
the term "hacker" had acquired elite connotations. In a general
sense, a computer hacker was any person who wrote software code for
the sake of writing software code. In the particular sense,
however, it was a testament to programming skill. Like the term
"artist," the meaning carried tribal overtones. To describe a
fellow programmer as hacker was a sign of respect. To describe
oneself as a hacker was a sign of immense personal confidence.
Either way, the original looseness of the computer-hacker
appellation diminished as computers became more common.</p>
<p>As the definition tightened, "computer" hacking acquired
additional semantic overtones. To be a hacker, a person had to do
more than write interesting software; a person had to belong to the
hacker "culture" and honor its traditions the same way a medieval
wine maker might pledge membership to a vintners' guild. The social
structure wasn't as rigidly outlined as that of a guild, but
hackers at elite institutions such as MIT, Stanford, and Carnegie
Mellon began to speak openly of a "hacker ethic": the yet-unwritten
rules that governed a hacker's day-to-day behavior. In the 1984
book [<span class="CITATION">Hackers</span>], author Steven Levy,
after much research and consultation, codified the hacker ethic as
five core hacker tenets.</p>
<p>In many ways, the core tenets listed by Levy continue to define
the culture of computer hacking. Still, the guild-like image of the
hacker community was undermined by the overwhelmingly populist bias
of the software industry. By the early 1980s, computers were
popping up everywhere, and programmers who once would have had to
travel to top-rank institutions or businesses just to gain access
to a machine suddenly had the ability to rub elbows with
major-league hackers via the ARPAnet. The more these programmers
rubbed elbows, the more they began to appropriate the anarchic
philosophies of the hacker culture in places like MIT. Lost within
the cultural transfer, however, was the native MIT cultural taboo
against malicious behavior. As younger programmers began employing
their computer skills to harmful ends-creating and disseminating
computer viruses, breaking into military computer systems,
deliberately causing machines such as MIT Oz, a popular ARPAnet
gateway, to crash--the term "hacker" acquired a punk, nihilistic
edge. When police and businesses began tracing computer-related
crimes back to a few renegade programmers who cited convenient
portions of the hacking ethic in defense of their activities, the
word "hacker" began appearing in newspapers and magazine stories in
a negative light. Although books like [<span class=
"CITATION">Hackers</span>] did much to document the original spirit
of exploration that gave rise to the hacking culture, for most news
reporters, "computer hacker" became a synonym for "electronic
burglar."</p>
<p>Although hackers have railed against this perceived misusage for
nearly two decades, the term's rebellious connotations dating back
to the 1950s make it hard to discern the 15-year-old writing
software programs that circumvent modern encryption programs from
the 1960s college student, picking locks and battering down doors
to gain access to the lone, office computer terminal. One person's
creative subversion of authority is another person's security
headache, after all. Even so, the central taboo against malicious
or deliberately harmful behavior remains strong enough that most
hackers prefer to use the term "cracker"--i.e., a person who
deliberately cracks a computer security system to steal or
vandalize data-to describe the subset of hackers who apply their
computing skills maliciously.</p>
<p>This central taboo against maliciousness remains the primary
cultural link between the notion of hacking in the early 21st
century and hacking in the 1950s. It is important to note that, as
the idea of computer hacking has evolved over the last four
decades, the original notion of hacking--i.e., performing pranks or
exploring underground tunnels-remains intact. In the fall of 2000,
the MIT Museum paid tradition to the Institute's age-old hacking
tradition with a dedicated exhibit, the Hall of Hacks. The exhibit
includes a number of photographs dating back to the 1920s,
including one involving a mock police cruiser. In 1993, students
paid homage to the original MIT notion of hacking by placing the
same police cruiser, lights flashing, atop the Institute's main
dome. The cruiser's vanity license plate read IHTFP, a popular MIT
acronym with many meanings. The most noteworthy version, itself
dating back to the pressure-filled world of MIT student life in the
1950s, is "I hate this fucking place." In 1990, however, the Museum
used the acronym as a basis for a journal on the history of hacks.
Titled, The Institute for Hacks Tomfoolery and Pranks, the journal
offers an adept summary of the hacking.</p>
<p>"In the culture of hacking, an elegant, simple creation is as
highly valued as it is in pure science," writes [<span class=
"CITATION">Boston Globe</span>] reporter Randolph Ryan in a 1993
article attached to the police car exhibit. "A Hack differs from
the ordinary college prank in that the event usually requires
careful planning, engineering and finesse, and has an underlying
wit and inventiveness," Ryan writes. "The unwritten rule holds that
a hack should be good-natured, non-destructive and safe. In fact,
hackers sometimes assist in dismantling their own handiwork."</p>
<p>The urge to confine the culture of computer hacking within the
same ethical boundaries is well-meaning but impossible. Although
most software hacks aspire to the same spirit of elegance and
simplicity, the software medium offers less chance for
reversibility. Dismantling a police cruiser is easy compared with
dismantling an idea, especially an idea whose time has come. Hence
the growing distinction between "black hat" and "white hat"--i.e.,
hackers who turn new ideas toward destructive, malicious ends
versus hackers who turn new ideas toward positive or, at the very
least, informative ends.</p>
<p>Once a vague item of obscure student jargon, the word "hacker"
has become a linguistic billiard ball, subject to political spin
and ethical nuances. Perhaps this is why so many hackers and
journalists enjoy using it. Where that ball bounces next, however,
is anybody's guess.</p></div>
