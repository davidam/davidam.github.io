<h1><a name="CHAPTER-12">Cap&iacute;tulo 12. A Brief Journey
Through Hacker Hell</a></h1>
<p>Richard Stallman stares, unblinking, through the windshield of a
rental car, waiting for the light to change as we make our way
through downtown Kihei.</p>
<p>The two of us are headed to the nearby town of Pa'ia, where we
are scheduled to meet up with some software programmers and their
wives for dinner in about an hour or so.</p>
<p>It's about two hours after Stallman's speech at the Maui High
Performance Center, and Kihei, a town that seemed so inviting
before the speech, now seems profoundly uncooperative. Like most
beach cities, Kihei is a one-dimensional exercise in suburban
sprawl. Driving down its main drag, with its endless succession of
burger stands, realty agencies, and bikini shops, it's hard not to
feel like a steel-coated morsel passing through the alimentary
canal of a giant commercial tapeworm. The feeling is exacerbated by
the lack of side roads. With nowhere to go but forward, traffic
moves in spring-like lurches. 200 yards ahead, a light turns green.
By the time we are moving, the light is yellow again.</p>
<p>For Stallman, a lifetime resident of the east coast, the
prospect of spending the better part of a sunny Hawaiian afternoon
trapped in slow traffic is enough to trigger an embolism. Even
worse is the knowledge that, with just a few quick right turns a
quarter mile back, this whole situation easily could have been
avoided. Unfortunately, we are at the mercy of the driver ahead of
us, a programmer from the lab who knows the way and who has decided
to take us to Pa'ia via the scenic route instead of via the nearby
Pilani Highway.</p>
<p>"This is terrible," says Stallman between frustrated sighs. "Why
didn't we take the other route?"</p>
<p>Again, the light a quarter mile ahead of us turns green. Again,
we creep forward a few more car lengths. This process continues for
another 10 minutes, until we finally reach a major crossroad
promising access to the adjacent highway.</p>
<p>The driver ahead of us ignores it and continues through the
intersection.</p>
<p>"Why isn't he turning?" moans Stallman, throwing up his hands in
frustration. "Can you believe this?"</p>
<p>I decide not to answer either. I find the fact that I am sitting
in a car with Stallman in the driver seat, in Maui no less,
unbelievable enough. Until two hours ago, I didn't even know
Stallman knew how to drive. Now, listening to Yo-Yo Ma's cello
playing the mournful bass notes of "Appalachian Journey" on the car
stereo and watching the sunset pass by on our left, I do my best to
fade into the upholstery.</p>
<p>When the next opportunity to turn finally comes up, Stallman
hits his right turn signal in an attempt to cue the driver ahead of
us. No such luck. Once again, we creep slowly through the
intersection, coming to a stop a good 200 yards before the next
light. By now, Stallman is livid.</p>
<p>"It's like he's deliberately ignoring us," he says, gesturing
and pantomiming like an air craft carrier landing-signals officer
in a futile attempt to catch our guide's eye. The guide appears
unfazed, and for the next five minutes all we see is a small
portion of his head in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>I look out Stallman's window. Nearby Kahoolawe and Lanai Islands
provide an ideal frame for the setting sun. It's a breathtaking
view, the kind that makes moments like this a bit more bearable if
you're a Hawaiian native, I suppose. I try to direct Stallman's
attention to it, but Stallman, by now obsessed by the
inattentiveness of the driver ahead of us, blows me off.</p>
<p>When the driver passes through another green light, completely
ignoring a "Pilani Highway Next Right," I grit my teeth. I remember
an early warning relayed to me by BSD programmer Keith Bostic.
"Stallman does not suffer fools gladly," Bostic warned me. "If
somebody says or does something stupid, he'll look them in the eye
and say, `That's stupid.'"</p>
<p>Looking at the oblivious driver ahead of us, I realize that it's
the stupidity, not the inconvenience, that's killing Stallman right
now.</p>
<p>"It's as if he picked this route with absolutely no thought on
how to get there efficiently," Stallman says.</p>
<p>The word "efficiently" hangs in the air like a bad odor. Few
things irritate the hacker mind more than inefficiency. It was the
inefficiency of checking the Xerox laser printer two or three times
a day that triggered Stallman's initial inquiry into the printer
source code. It was the inefficiency of rewriting software tools
hijacked by commercial software vendors that led Stallman to battle
Symbolics and to launch the GNU Project. If, as Jean Paul Sartre
once opined, hell is other people, hacker hell is duplicating other
people's stupid mistakes, and it's no exaggeration to say that
Stallman's entire life has been an attempt to save mankind from
these fiery depths.</p>
<p>This hell metaphor becomes all the more apparent as we take in
the slowly passing scenery. With its multitude of shops, parking
lots, and poorly timed street lights, Kihei seems less like a city
and more like a poorly designed software program writ large.
Instead of rerouting traffic and distributing vehicles through side
streets and expressways, city planners have elected to run
everything through a single main drag. From a hacker perspective,
sitting in a car amidst all this mess is like listening to a CD
rendition of nails on a chalkboard at full volume.</p>
<p>"Imperfect systems infuriate hackers," observes Steven Levy,
another warning I should have listened to before climbing into the
car with Stallman. "This is one reason why hackers generally hate
driving cars--the system of randomly programmed red lights and
oddly laid out one-way streets causes delays which are so goddamn
<em>unnecessary</em> [Levy's emphasis] that the impulse is to
rearrange signs, open up traffic-light control boxes &hellip;
redesign the entire system." <a name="AEN2639" href=
"#FTN.AEN2639">[1]</a></p>
<p>More frustrating, however, is the duplicity of our trusted
guide. Instead of searching out a clever shortcut--as any true
hacker would do on instinct--the driver ahead of us has instead
chosen to play along with the city planners' game. Like Virgil in
Dante's [<span class="CITATION">Inferno</span>], our guide is
determined to give us the full guided tour of this hacker hell
whether we want it or not.</p>
<p>Before I can make this observation to Stallman, the driver
finally hits his right turn signal. Stallman's hunched shoulders
relax slightly, and for a moment the air of tension within the car
dissipates. The tension comes back, however, as the driver in front
of us slows down. "Construction Ahead" signs line both sides of the
street, and even though the Pilani Highway lies less than a quarter
mile off in the distance, the two-lane road between us and the
highway is blocked by a dormant bulldozer and two large mounds of
dirt.</p>
<p>It takes Stallman a few seconds to register what's going on as
our guide begins executing a clumsy five-point U-turn in front of
us. When he catches a glimpse of the bulldozer and the "No Through
Access" signs just beyond, Stallman finally boils over.</p>
<p>"Why, why, why?" he whines, throwing his head back. "You should
have known the road was blocked. You should have known this way
wouldn't work. You did this deliberately."</p>
<p>The driver finishes the turn and passes us on the way back
toward the main drag. As he does so, he shakes his head and gives
us an apologetic shrug. Coupled with a toothy grin, the driver's
gesture reveals a touch of mainlander frustration but is tempered
with a protective dose of islander fatalism. Coming through the
sealed windows of our rental car, it spells out a succinct message:
"Hey, it's Maui; what are you gonna do?"</p>
<p>Stallman can take it no longer.</p>
<p>"Don't you fucking smile!" he shouts, fogging up the glass as he
does so. "It's your fucking fault. This all could have been so much
easier if we had just done it my way."</p>
<p>Stallman accents the words "my way" by gripping the steering
wheel and pulling himself towards it twice. The image of Stallman's
lurching frame is like that of a child throwing a temper tantrum in
a car seat, an image further underlined by the tone of Stallman's
voice. Halfway between anger and anguish, Stallman seems to be on
the verge of tears.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the tears do not arrive. Like a summer cloudburst,
the tantrum ends almost as soon as it begins. After a few whiny
gasps, Stallman shifts the car into reverse and begins executing
his own U-turn. By the time we are back on the main drag, his face
is as impassive as it was when we left the hotel 30 minutes
earlier.</p>
<p>It takes less than five minutes to reach the next cross-street.
This one offers easy highway access, and within seconds, we are
soon speeding off toward Pa'ia at a relaxing rate of speed. The sun
that once loomed bright and yellow over Stallman's left shoulder is
now burning a cool orange-red in our rearview mirror. It lends its
color to the gauntlet wili wili trees flying past us on both sides
of the highway.</p>
<p>For the next 20 minutes, the only sound in our vehicle, aside
from the ambient hum of the car's engine and tires, is the sound of
a cello and a violin trio playing the mournful strains of an
Appalachian folk tune.</p></div>
