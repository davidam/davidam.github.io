Today we are in a moment, where the smartphones and tablets is being
more and more used. It is performing a change in the market of
operating system and the feeling of values of triumph in this market.

* From Personal Computers to Tablets and Smartphones

The market of operating system in the internet access is suffering a
very strong change from personal computers and laptops to tablets and
smartphones in the next graphics, we can see the evolution:

* Looking at Microsoft Windows: From the Sucessfull to the Drecreasing

Microsoft Windows won the battle in the personal computers thanks a
good trade agreements with IBM, the privative licenses, similar
features to the competence (for instance, Macintosh), and the freedom
to choose the hardware. The image of Microsoft is the successful in
the bussiness.

Microsoft did start late in the market of smartphones and tablets with
Nokia, this agreement allows has market, but not win in the market. 

From 2009 to 2014 has decreased from 89.44% to 43.87% of global market
of Internet users in Wikipedia in the non mobile version. 

* Looking at Macintosh: Reborning 

Macintosh was an innovative operating system loved by many graphical
designers.

The strategy of Macintosh is the same. The company launch a new
product with innovative features in a specific hardware. The market is
different than the personal computers, you can change pieces in a
personal computer with a free market, you obtain more cheaper prices
if you has many hardware vendors. In the market of smartphones and
tablets you don't change many pieces, you change the full device, in
this market has sense the Macintosh strategy.

From 2009 to 2014 has decreased from 6.05% to 5.85% of global market
of internet users in the non mobile version. In the mobile version has
grow from 0.06% to 0.68%. iPhone has grow from 0.93% to 22.34%. iPad
has grow from 0.93% to 10.34%. In summary, iPhone and iPad has grow
from 0.99% to 32.68% of Internet users in Wikipedia.

* Looking at Google: Borning in the Operating System Market

Google born as a university toy of two students of Stanford and today
is the most used search engine in the world. Google had been thinking
the entry in the operating system market with his own version of
GNU/Linux based on cloud. Finally, Google did launch Android with
innovative hardware trademarks in competition with Apple.

Android has grown from 2009 to 2014 from 0.03% to 11.03%.

* Why the Microsoft strategy is not running?

Really, the laptop market is similar than the smartphones and tablets
market in the sense that you don't change the pieces, but in the
laptop market the apps is new, then there are not qwerty effect and
you can choose the apps that you consider cool, or you have installed
by default it gives more power to the Microsoft competence.

So, in this field the innovation is so important. Microsoft use to be
better in the bussiness. Microsoft could grow if there are more and
more comercial agreement or feeling more closed to the innovative
cultures: free software communities or universities.


* What happens whith the free software movement?

The public of the free software movement is the people worried by the
ethical problems of the privative software or by technical power
shared by this community.

Android mix free and not free software in the same solution, the
percentages that an Android user can have of non free software could
have is so bigger that in Ubuntu (for instance). Really, the Android
users don't know that is free, they only want a good product. But it
allows grows important pieces, such as the Linux kernel in number of
users.

So, the pure GNU/Linux users is more or less stable, but the market of
free software users (in general) is growing, but not with the original
values of GNU, is growing with pragmatical values of market. 

In the Free Software Foundation Europe there are a campaign to Free
your Android (https://fsfe.org/campaigns/android/android.en.html), that
is remove the non free software from your Android.

IMHO, the GNU movement has the same problem from years: the
market. The problem thinking in the market is forget the etical
values. But to preserve and recognise this idealistic values and not
only by innovative solutions is necesary to be strong in the economy
with values: ethical banks, fair trade, cooperatives, etc. It could be
an interesting challenge in the free software movement.

* Conclusion

Whith the change of devices, we are seeing a change to operating
systems more innovatives, giving the end to the Microsoft monopoly in
the Internet access.
